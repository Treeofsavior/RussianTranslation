ETC_20151022_015922	Evil Necroventer
ETC_20151022_015923	Lapemiter is a unique occupation that is highly respected, but is also looked down upon among Lapes. A Lapemiter serves a religious role, but the other Lapes don't put great emphasis on religious rituals, so they want a Lapemiter to do their exhausting duty.
ETC_20151022_015924	Unlike the prejudice of the humans, Lapezards are not Lapes that obtained their current status through long training. Most of them are selected by their breeds and they grow up accordingly and receive the necessary food to become a Lapezard.
ETC_20151022_015925	Their status is not high among Lapes, but they are most dangerous and they get encountered often. To receive respect from the other Lapes, they act violently to the ones they encounter with.
ETC_20151022_015926	For a Lape to Lapflammer, they just need to obtain the weapons they need. But its not that easy since when Lapflammers die, the weapons also get destroyed so its not that easy for the Lapes.
ETC_20151022_015927	Ferret Archers usually engages in battles, but they sometimes shoot down the fruits on tall trees. It's not that other ferrets asked them to do it, but they just do that for fun when they are not engaged in battles.
ETC_20151022_015928	They sometimes move the objects, but they usually share the processed fruit products to other ferrets. It is unknown whether they receive any rewards for that or they are responsible to do so.
ETC_20151022_015929	They look small, but they are matured ferrets. They sometimes become other ferrets depending on the properties of the breeds and the environment that they live in.
ETC_20151022_015930	This ferret does not possess any distinct characteristic. But due to long labor, they possess strong power, so you should not underestimate it.
ETC_20151022_015931	Ferret Empty Porter
ETC_20151022_015932	They do work while supervising the works of other ferrets.
ETC_20151022_015933	This ferret is responsible for looking for other enemies and useful fruits.
ETC_20151022_015934	Like Ferret Archers, they either attack enemies or shoot down the fruits. One advantage they have over archers is that they sometimes use hard fruits as bullets.
ETC_20151022_015935	Ferret Supply Soldier
ETC_20151022_015936	This ferret has an inferior status compared to the other ferrets. This ferret helps with the works of other ferrets and they also participate in battles.

ETC_20160922_024230	Keep the torch on for 1 minutes!
ETC_20160925_024235	A spirit that became evil after coming into contact with something demonic. It is not a human spirit turned evil, but a spirit corrupted after fusing with a demonic one.
ETC_20160925_024236	It became ever more difficult for Goddess Austeja to look over this task, and so this type of monsters started to appear.
ETC_20160925_024237	Ellaganos are undead creatures that become fused with their gravestones and emerge after a long period of time possessing enormous power.
ETC_20160925_024238	Some Demon Lords create their own forces or distribute their power to perform other tasks. This is one of such cases. Sorcerers are also known to profit from magic that uses the characteristics of these demons.
ETC_20160925_024239	Molich has served several Demon Lords over the centuries and is likely to keep advancing into higher ranks. Experts who have studied demon history predict that, if he does, he could surpass even lower-rank Demon Lords such as Bramble or Mirtis.
ETC_20160925_024240	Ghosts under the influence of demons can take various forms and appearances.
ETC_20160925_024241	Demon Lord Bramble is considered the least ingenious. Gesti, who favors simpler personalities, however, granted him higher authority. Bramble is also believed to have nearly succeeded in seizing a goddess relic, a task where other Demon Lords have failed.
ETC_20160925_024242	Medzio Diena brought about several forms of mutated monsters. Among them is the Golem, whose mutations, thus far unknown, could be either of magic or natural origin.
ETC_20160925_024243	Unlike what it may seem, this monster lives only in highly specific environmental conditions.
ETC_20160925_024244	This monster's eyesight isn't actually bad, despite what its name might suggest.
ETC_20160925_024245	A subspecies of the Hanaming. Recently found and currently still in research.
ETC_20160925_024246	The subordinate of Demon Lord Mirtis in charge of reconnaissance operations. Some believe him to be an alter ego.
ETC_20160925_024247	Usually referred to as a monster that returned from the dead. In reality, it underwent death to be reborn as a demon.
ETC_20160925_024248	As a monster of mineral-type mutation, it is unclear why it bears resemblance to a whale.
ETC_20160925_024249	While most fairy or spirit-type creatures have sided not with humans and goddesses but with demons, the small minority that hasn't is currently taking a neutral stance. Genies are one type of such creatures.
ETC_20160925_024250	Insect-type monsters mutated during Medzio Diena are known to have queens or other monarch entities.
ETC_20160925_024251	For unknown reasons, after mutating during Medzio Diena this monster shows high hostility towards the goddesses.
ETC_20160925_024252	Although it does not affect humans, this monster strongly dislikes other insect types besides itself, particularly bee-type monsters.
ETC_20160925_024253	Powerful insect-type monsters tend to become either vicious hunters or influential individuals. The latter group, in which the Throneweaver is included, is particularly dangerous, as they often side with demons.
ETC_20160925_024254	Humans have attempted to tame these monsters before they grow, but only demons have succeeded in doing so.
ETC_20160925_024255	The most difficult aspect about dealing with these monsters is that they can appear in people's houses unexpectedly.
ETC_20160925_024256	As a bird, it is easily attracted to bird feed. Demons use this to make these monsters attack humans.
ETC_20160925_024257	It is unclear whether it was mutated during Medzio Diena or through a Demon Lord ritual. In any case, it was once a useful piece of equipment.
ETC_20160925_024258	It is not known whether these monsters transformed after Medzio Diena and moved from the sea to the land as a result or if they are originally demonic beings. Goddess Jurate is not interested in them.
ETC_20160925_024259	Shadowgaler was originally a spirit, but it embraced the power of the demons on Medzio Diena.
ETC_20160925_024260	Rexipher is known as the wisest Demon Lord among all Demon Lords. The reason why he is not active as he should be is because the Demon Queen Gesti doesn't know how to use him effectively. That is good for humans.
ETC_20160925_024261	He has the tendency to control evil spirits and steal the power from those who do not obey him in order to accumulate even greater power.
ETC_20160925_024262	It may be easy to think of these monsters' mutated appearance on land, completely unrelated to any kind of sea creature, as the work of demons. In fact, this phenomenon cannot be explained that easily.
ETC_20160925_024263	The theory that Linkrollers move by magical reaction has been proven. However, what's interesting is that this was not designed by anyone, it was simply created naturally around Medzio Diena.
ETC_20160925_024264	Many people are participating on the efforts to prevent them from producing offspring by spurting out spores.
ETC_20160925_024265	It was never observed before that a monster which was originally a bug turned into an imago type monster. It shouldn't occur when you look at it.
ETC_20160925_024266	Nederbovine bases its origin on the demon realm. This is not an intelligent demon. It is a beast that is being raised by demons.
ETC_20160925_024267	It is unknownn what type of animal this monster consumes in order to obtain its eyes.
ETC_20160925_024268	A long time ago, he was the hidden guardian who used to protect graves from robbers.
ETC_20160925_024269	Many monsters created lots of diverse transformations on Medzio Diena, but Carapace is unique among them. It was created from the shell which was molted from other animals.
ETC_20160925_024270	Werewolves have been drifting diverse worlds from a long time ago. They don't belong to any world and they think Medzio Diena will be a good chance for them.

ETC_20160925_024303	By looking at the spear Ticen is carrrying, the assumption that there may be other kinds of Ticens turned out to be true, with many kinds of Ticens created now moving in herds. They care about sociality.

ETC_20171128_029575	A female Nimrah. After their mutation, Nimrah males focused only on battle and started to neglect their eggs. This is no different for the Damsel. Oceanographers and other researchers are studying their changed habits, but have yet to find anything solid.

ETC_20171128_029582	Varle Gunner
ETC_20171128_029583	If you are pressed into finding a human society equivalent, the closest thing would be an independent mercenary. Of course, this doesn't mean that the Gunner has no loyalties. Varle social tendencies are difficult for a normal person to understand.
ETC_20171128_029584	Varle Hench
ETC_20171128_029585	The Varle will fight other Varle if not from the same group. The Varle Hench is usually in charge of pioneering and scouting and is normally the first to fall.
ETC_20171128_029586	Varle Skipper
ETC_20171128_029587	After Medzio Diena, oceanic creatures chose one of three paths whether they had mutated or not. They could still follow Goddess Jurate, cooperate with the demons, or act independently. While the Varle are independent, they had always had a certain dislike for humans making many think that they are cooperating with demons. Varle Skippers are among the leading elite of the Varle society.
ETC_20171128_029588	Varle Henchmen
ETC_20171128_029589	Despite what they may look and act like, Varle Henchmen are even more important than Varle Skippers. That is because the influence of Varle Skippers are measured in how many Varle Henchmen are following them. As such, a Varle Skipper without any Varle Henchmen is nothing more than an empty flag.
ETC_20171128_029590	Varle Anchor
ETC_20171128_029591	Varle Anchors are usually older Varle, which might seem surprising. Of course, there are younger Varle as well, but this is because they are well experienced. While Anchors will also participate in battle, they are used to show their dominance over a certain area.

Only Goddess Jurate might understand this madness.
ETC_20171128_029594	Kindron Weilder
ETC_20171128_029595	Unlike most other mutated sea creatures, the Kindron were always distant with Goddess Jurate. They used to be the scavengers of the ocean before they mutated during Medzio Diena. There are some that still remain loyal to Goddess Jurate, but most have become hostile towards her.

ETC_20171128_029602	Lake Golem
ETC_20171128_029603	A magical levitation stone from the Starlit Lake that turned into a monster during Medzio Diena. It was thought to only exist near Starlit Lake since most of the magical levitation stones throughout human history were used there, but it seems as if the Kedora Merchant Alliance and Agailla Flurry had quite a few of their own. 
ETC_20171128_029604	Fondus
ETC_20171128_029605	Fondus were known to occasionally appear near Starlit Lake even before Medzio Diena. There was a massive increase in their population after Medzio Diena. The liquid on top of the Fondus is an extremely rare foodstuff. It costs a fortune to detoxicate it enough to be fit for human consumption. It may be put back on the tables of nobles if the Schaffen Star manages to recover.
ETC_20171128_029606	Anchor Golem
ETC_20171128_029607	The Anchor Golem is a monster that is derived from the linkage in the magical levitation stone. 
ETC_20171128_029608	Lily Velly
ETC_20171128_029609	The Lily Velly has the ability to levitate which means it can appear anywhere.

ETC_20171128_029614	Litchiring
ETC_20171128_029615	The vegetation in the Great Woodlands was not tropical. There was no change in climate after Medzio Diena either. As such, it is a mystery as to why there are so many plant-type monsters in that region. The same can be said to why the Litchiring is found amongst the White Tree Forest.
ETC_20171128_029616	Yakyak
ETC_20171128_029617	According to legend, the Yak are demons that are looking for a king to succeed the fallen king that they had been contractually bound to.

ETC_20171128_029625	Bush Beetle
ETC_20171128_029626	There is a theory about monsters derived from insects after Medzio Diena. Scholars think that insects that mutated under the influence of magic will mutate into only having two eyes instead of the original insectoid eyes. It is believed that the Bush Beetle is such a case, but nobody has managed to get proper evidence to back this theory.
ETC_20171128_029627	Blossom Beetle
ETC_20171128_029628	While unconfirmed, it is thought that the Blossom Beetle is a form of insectoid undead. If so, the flower on it's back is growing on a carcass.

ETC_20171128_029640	The Great Woodlands are heavily wooded as you might expect.

ETC_20171128_029641	Half Mangosting
ETC_20171128_029642	Despite the fact that it has already been 4 years since Medzio Diena, there are still some people trying to eat monsters that look similar to fruits even if they don't taste good enough to die for. Please don't risk your life to make a Half Mangosting, it isn't worth it.

They appear as sea-faring creatures that don't have any relation to minerals and appear in areas that are far from the oceans. Nobody has yet solved the mystery behind these monsters. The reason this particular Stone Orca is red is because of the oxidized steel.
ETC_20171128_029647	Black Hohen Orben
ETC_20171128_029648	Hohen competed against humans since the birth of the kingdom. They were cooperative to demons instead of the goddesses, but they posed no big problems since their amount was small compared to humans. However, the environment that Medzio Diena changed is working more advantageous for Hohens instead of humans so it is not certain whether humans would have an edge over them in the future. Hohen that were more active in the demonic world are black.
ETC_20171128_029649	Black Harugal
ETC_20171128_029650	The fact that the Harugal, mavericks of the demonic world are still holding on can be traced back to two reasons. One is the fact that demons don't track down outsiders if they aren't ordered to. The other is because Harugal are quite strong and ferocious. Those that have been in a lot of conflicts in the demonic world have black fur. 
ETC_20171128_029651	Oscuro
ETC_20171128_029652	The Oscuro are born high above the demonic world and grow heavier the longer they live. They start living closer to the ground as they do so because the growth rate of their wings is too slow to sustain their flight. They basically crawl on the ground just before they die.

ETC_20171128_029653	Claro
ETC_20171128_029654	Souls and consciousness are prey of the Claro.

ETC_20171128_029658	Similar to a Bookmark Mimic. Wherever this monster appears in the world, the fact that it comes from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library is undeniable. However, humans know little about the Fantasy Library and as such little is known about this monster.
ETC_20171128_029659	Archless Angel
ETC_20171128_029660	Demons do not deal well with hardship and pain. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule and there are certain demons that rise above the rest after enduring hardship.

ETC_20171128_029661	Luna Angel
ETC_20171128_029662	The Luna Angel is born during the process of the Archless Angel becoming stronger. Most of the chaos from the Archless Angel is given to the Luna Angel during this process. They become entirely separate entities after this and live their individual lives.

ETC_20171128_029667	Crowvasia
ETC_20171128_029668	Crowvasia all have different personalities which means that the only thing the Crowvasia have in common is the fact that they have nothing in common. They are known to follow Hauberk, and this is thought to be because at least one of Hauberk's diverse personalities suit the Crowvasia. There are of course just as many that hate Hauberk for the same reasons. It is difficult for even high ranking demons to utilize Crowvasia on a large scale if they aren't Giltine. It is rumored that Giltine has in fact mobilized many of them recently.
ETC_20171128_029669	Rotascion
ETC_20171128_029670	Most demons prefer chaos over order. Rotascion are one of the most extreme. Only the strongest demons will be able to bend them to their will.  
ETC_20171128_029671	Boogey Box
ETC_20171128_029672	They are not animals nor inanimate objects. They are demons and yet they are not demons. They have souls yet they do not have souls. They are born when chaotic demons such as the Crowvasia or Rotascion hide their souls to objects after defying stronger demons and failing. Of course, they show peculiar traits due to their chaotic souls. As such, it is better to see them as inanimate objects turned into monsters rather than the souls of demons.
ETC_20171128_029673	Cretobien
ETC_20171128_029674	The Cretobien is a demon that was unknown to humans before Medzio Diena. As such, it is speculated that this demon might actually dislike being in our world.
ETC_20171128_029675	Creto
ETC_20171128_029676	Humans don't know what the Creto do in the demonic world. Some say that they might provide entertainment to higher demons based on their appearance, but this is most likely an error in judgment because demons don't have the same emotions as humans.
ETC_20171128_029677	Varle King
ETC_20171128_029678	The Varle King is the most revered among all Varle. Many Varle King are cooperating with Demon King Kartas in order to widen their realms. Those from the Zealot Order dislike all that have betrayed Goddess Jurate and they especially dislike the Varle Kings.

ETC_20171128_029684	Demon Lord Warpulis
ETC_20171128_029685	Warpulis is one that gets along nicely with Demon King Kartas as they both have fickle personalities. It seems as if Chaos itself has worked itself into this being as Warpulis is ready to sneer at it's opponents while brutally attacking them. As such, no other Demon Lord is interested in keeping Warpulis as a minion. Only Demon King Kartas seems to be able to handle Warpulis.

ETC_20180418_031977	Velcoffer
ETC_20180418_031978	Velcoffer Guards aren't demons, but regular animals that mutated into monsters. What's more, the advent of these beasts wasn't caused by Medzio Diena. The Sage Master speculates that they were one of the monster species said to have been exiled from our world in a joint effort by goddesses and demons. As there are no records of these monsters prior to Medzio Diena, it's possible that the disaster set them free from the seals that detained them.
ETC_20180418_031979	Tainted Gargoyle
ETC_20180418_031980	As Demon Lord Baiga gradually takes on Gesti's legacy, the demons that protected his territory have been appearing more frequently in our world. One example of that is the Tainted Gargoyle.
ETC_20180418_031981	Cave Minivern
ETC_20180418_031982	Cave Miniverns are the scavengers of the demon world. They can feed on carcasses, but they tend to hunt other small necrophagous animals. These monsters aren't built to live underground, but they are often spotted in sewers or caves, where they go to hunt.
ETC_20180418_031983	Velcoffaner
ETC_20180418_031984	Better known as subordinates of Demon King Kartas. Although some monsters tend to change masters with ease, this species is said to dutifully obey every whim of their commandant.
ETC_20180418_031985	Cave Minivern Warrior
ETC_20180418_031986	Cave Miniverns are less prone to following orders, preferring to listen to their instinctive needs. Therefore, this species was modified by high-rank demons to play a more specific role in combat. It is slightly stronger and more intelligent than other Miniverns.
ETC_20180418_031987	Cave Minivern Mage
ETC_20180418_031988	Some Cave Minivern Warriors have the ability to draw out magic from their bodies through the process of awakening. These monsters are an example of that.

ETC_20180817_034900	[Event] Secret of the Stone Plates
ETC_20180827_034901	It is not uncommon for inanimate objects to become monsters after Medzio Diena, but the appearance of candlesticks on the heads of existing monsters remains a curious phenomenon. 
ETC_20180827_034902	According to a courageous observer, the two heads often quarrel with each other. If it weren't for their anatomy preventing either head from hurting the other, murder-suicides would likely be a common occurrence.
ETC_20180827_034903	A monster born on Medzio Diena. After discovering these monsters, the demons trained them to pull carriages, and sent those with good combat abilities to the human realm.
ETC_20180827_034904	Velnippers are the strongest of all Insect type monsters. They aren't invincible, but their chances of defeating other Insect monsters are high due to the venom they produce, which is particularly lethal to insects. 
ETC_20180827_034905	This insect predator evolved to grow into a larger body, meaning it must now hunt and consume prey in large quantities to survive. That is, in fact, the reason why this species is not as abundant as others. 
ETC_20180827_034906	For centuries Demon Lord Solcomm has attempted to attack the Astral Tower and Pbeta traveled between the demon realm and our world to aid him. But deep down, Pbeta was dissatisfied and his resentment against Solcomm grew. One day, Pbeta was unable to bear with Solcomm any longer and decided to revolt against him.  
ETC_20180827_034907	Although the Schaffenstar will likely continue to exist, Ignas was the last head of the organization to be entrusted with a Revelation. He not only secretly murdered his predecessor but also manipulated the Demon Lord Solcomm and Pbeta to his own advantage and appropriated the power of a demon monarch. Despite his heinous actions, he was a man of exceptional talent, perhaps even comparable to the founder of the Schaffenstar, Lydia Schaffen.
ETC_20180827_034908	Kabad was bound in a powerful contract after losing a battle. It is said that, after the term of the contract is complete, Kabad's eyes will be returned to it.
ETC_20180827_034909	Even after transforming, this monster is known to have retained its ferocious nature. In fact, it is more vicious than many wild animals prior to the advent of domestication.
ETC_20180827_034910	Wyvern
ETC_20180827_034911	Its name may be similar to the Mallet Wyvern's, but they are two entirely distinct species.
ETC_20180827_034912	Chess Special Popup Book
ETC_20180827_034913	Lavenzard
ETC_20180827_034914	Teal Specter
ETC_20180827_034915	Although Teal Specter is dead, Medzio Diena has allowed his spirit to remain. Due to the strong magic he possessed in life, his spirit has a different composition from that of other specters.
ETC_20180827_034916	Lotuscat
ETC_20180827_034917	Monster born of the combination of magic stones and lake plants. Before Medzio Diena, they were spotted once every ten years on average. Now, they have increased in number and their population has become more difficult to control.  
ETC_20180827_034918	Pate
ETC_20180827_034919	Pates are known to appear in lakes when the quality of the water is low. These monsters existed prior to Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_034920	Coterie
ETC_20180827_034921	Coteries live in groups across all kinds of aquatic habitats, from ocean trenches to continental freshwater bodies.
ETC_20180827_034922	Lilly Maid
ETC_20180827_034923	Lilly Maids existed prior to Medzio Diena. Before the Schaffenstar began producing chemical baits for them, they were known to lure and drown local lake dwellers.
ETC_20180827_034924	Spinacho
ETC_20180827_034925	These monsters were once curbstones in the demon world that came to life when Demon Lord Solcomm enchanted them to become part of his troops.
ETC_20180827_034926	Rubeta
ETC_20180827_034927	Rubetas are an extremely prolific species. Despite being the most commonly hunted monster in the heydays of the Schaffenstar, they continue to prosper after Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_034928	Little Rubeta
ETC_20180827_034929	Little Rubetas can be frequently spotted after Medzio Diena. They did exist prior to that, but Rubetas develop quickly enough that it was rare to come across an infant. Nowadays, their growing numbers have made young Rubetas more common than ever.
ETC_20180827_034930	Noli Maid
ETC_20180827_034931	Long ago, it was thought that Noli Maids buried the lower half of their bodies under rocks to camouflage as flowers. Now we know that their roots gain mobility as the Maids turns into adults.
ETC_20180827_034932	Beissen
ETC_20180827_034933	Curiously, some Kindron have been known to live in fresh water after Medzio Diena. They are found not only in estuaries but far from the sea in continental lakes as well.
ETC_20180827_034934	Mutt
ETC_20180827_034935	Before Ignas took control of the Astral Tower, the water of the Starlit Lake was lethal to demons. To solve this, Demon Lord Solcomm created the Mutts and commanded them to construct a passageway through the lake.
ETC_20180827_034936	Naste
ETC_20180827_034937	Nastes are the materialization of Astral Tower Schaffenstar members transformed under the influence of the demons. Ignas controls their minds, forcing them to obey him.
ETC_20180827_034938	Gleam Lens
ETC_20180827_034939	Like Mad Lenses, Gleam Lens monsters were once magic lenses left behind by Lydia Schaffen that transformed under the effects of Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_034940	Rabbler
ETC_20180827_034941	Rabblers and Punters are closely related creatures that serve in the demon world as both livestock and hunting companions. 
ETC_20180827_034942	Wryer
ETC_20180827_034943	Rumors tell that Wryers were once used as companions by Schaffenstar hunters before they became too ferocious and turned into monsters.
ETC_20180827_034944	Nasleia
ETC_20180827_034945	Nasleias are former Schaffenstar members that were transformed by magic to serve Ignas. It is said that they have no recollection of their lives as humans.
ETC_20180827_034946	Mad Lens
ETC_20180827_034947	Like Gleam Lenses, Mad Lens monsters were once magic lenses left behind by Lydia Schaffen that transformed under the effects of Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_034948	Grob
ETC_20180827_034949	Grobs are thought to have been used by Ignas in his battles against the Resistance army, or by Solcomm in his attacks against the Schaffenstar. In either case, we know these monsters were introduced to the lake for combat purposes.
ETC_20180827_034950	Hafter
ETC_20180827_034951	Some believe that Hafters may have once been the handles of telescopes placed around the Astral Tower. Conducting research at the Schaffenstar is impossible, however, so this hypothesis has never been confirmed.
ETC_20180827_034952	Waglog
ETC_20180827_034953	One could wonder where all these wooden barrels could have come from to transform into monsters, but the truth is that they are a common object found in any human assemblage.
ETC_20180827_034954	Glove Golem
ETC_20180827_034955	The Astral Tower is independently governed by the Schaffenstar, so research on the monsters that inhabit it is scarce. Because of this, we do not know whether Glove Golems appeared due to Medzio Diena or if Ignas created them voluntarily.
ETC_20180827_034956	Punter
ETC_20180827_034957	These monsters were brought into the Astral Tower after Ignas joined sides with the demons. They are said to inhabit extreme locations in the demon realm.
ETC_20180827_034958	Moltooth
ETC_20180827_034959	These creatures turned into monsters and began walking upright after Medzio Diena. Unable to return to their underground habitats, they began to hunt on the surface.
ETC_20180827_034960	Bishop Star
ETC_20180827_034961	Besides the fact that they originate from the demon realm, little is known about Bishopstars. Perhaps more will be revealed when future humans explore the demon world.
ETC_20180827_034962	Wajak Walker
ETC_20180827_034963	These monsters were pieces of furniture from the Fallen City that came to life after Medzio Diena. Many are the wooden objects that became monsters after that tragic day.
ETC_20180827_034964	Horong Walker
ETC_20180827_034965	Horong Walkers were born of a strange mutation involving will-o'-the-wisps.
ETC_20180827_034966	Bishop Gray
ETC_20180827_034967	Bishop Grays are said to be the clerics of the demon world, serving the Demon Goddess Ragana.
ETC_20180827_034968	Bishop Point
ETC_20180827_034969	Bishop Points are under the command of demon-world clerics who serve the Demon Goddess Ragana. Although she is only a minor figure in the demon realm, Ragana doesn't seem to cherish them as her followers.
ETC_20180827_034970	Kigle
ETC_20180827_034971	Kigles are monsters transformed from small-scale secret weapons of the Royal Army.
ETC_20180827_034972	Kigle Lops
ETC_20180827_034973	Kigles are monsters transformed from secret weapons of the Royal Army, after their magic began to react to the events of Medzio Diena. After that, General Lhamin halted the production of the weapons, and nowadays they are longer found in the Royal Army.
ETC_20180827_034974	Bishop Blanco
ETC_20180827_034975	Bishop Blancos are said to perform the role of altar servers to Demon Goddess Ragana. That is only an analogy, of course, as there is no direct equivalent in the human world.
ETC_20180827_034976	Bishop Hart
ETC_20180827_034977	Bishop Harts are demon-world clerics under the command of demon religious orders who serve Demon Goddess Ragana.
ETC_20180827_034978	Poncer
ETC_20180827_034979	Poncers are at the top of the food chain in their habitat. They can easily take down a human soldier and, despite their power, they are known to attack only in large groups, making them virtually invincible. Their small stature, however, means that they can become targets to other strong creatures when they are alone.  
ETC_20180827_034980	Yishoneer
ETC_20180827_034981	Species in the Yishon family were once nocturnal animals that lived in groups, until Medzio Diena turned them into monsters.
ETC_20180827_034982	Yishon Torcher
ETC_20180827_034983	Species in the Yishon family were once nocturnal animals that lived in groups, until Medzio Diena turned them into monsters. Some became active during the daytime and lost their eyesight, but at the same time they learned to use simple tools.
ETC_20180827_034984	Cave Stonacorn
ETC_20180827_034985	Cave Stonacorns originated from plant seeds mixed in the excrements of bats and other creatures.
ETC_20180827_034986	Solcomm Summon
ETC_20180827_034987	Kindron Leader
ETC_20180827_034988	Kindron Leaders are called that because they tend to stand at the front in battles. Unlike their moniker, however, their position is rather low in the Kindron hierarchy.
ETC_20180827_034989	Kindron Boor
ETC_20180827_034990	All Kindron species that adapted to freshwater habitats eventually separated from Goddess Jurate. At sea, there are still Kindrons who follow the goddess, although they constitute a minority.
ETC_20180827_034991	Humming Duke
ETC_20180827_034992	Most people believe Humming Dukes to be a gruesome hybrid species that combines mosquitoes and insects created after Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_034993	Night Panto Mage
ETC_20180827_034994	These monsters were responsible for leading the negotiations of the Night Panto agreement. We know for sure that Night Pantos entered the Astral Tower after the agreement, although it is still uncertain how they arrived in the Fallen City. The contents of that agreement also remain unknown.
ETC_20180827_034995	Pipi
ETC_20180827_034996	In his efforts to annihilate the Resistance, Ignas acquired the Pipis before Medzio Diena and hatched them to serve in his own army.
ETC_20180827_034997	Vespera
ETC_20180827_034998	Well-grown Piangs become Vesperas. According to rumors, they once helped Ignas gain the upper hand in a battle against the Resistance.
ETC_20180827_034999	Beetlegreen
ETC_20180827_035000	These monsters settled in the Kingdom's capital after it became a site of ruins. Because of that, they suffered little influence from Medzio Diena and have maintained most of their original form.
ETC_20180827_035001	Bumblegreen
ETC_20180827_035002	Besides the larger body, Bumblegreens have remained mostly unchanged since Medzio Diena. That said, they have become incredibly adaptable to new environments.
ETC_20180827_035003	Night Panto Archer
ETC_20180827_035004	It is said that Night Panto Archers are set to receive access to the archery secrets in the Astral Tower after the end of their contract. Alas, that which they covet the most will never be theirs.
ETC_20180827_035005	Nastudeu
ETC_20180827_035006	Ignas created the Nastudeu by cursing members of the Schaffenstar with his own blood and transforming them. Unlike Nastes and Nasleias, however, theoretically it should be impossible to return the Nastudeu to their original form.
ETC_20180827_035007	Night Panto Stellar
ETC_20180827_035008	An unknown agreement of cooperation with the demons is known to have given special powers to a large number of Pantos, which have since changed into a new appearance. Although the other party in the agreement is not a demon, they are suspected to work in conjunction with them. 
ETC_20180827_035009	Piang
ETC_20180827_035010	Pipis who hatch become Piangs. Their stages of development are said to apply differently in the demon realm.
ETC_20180827_035011	Mushuta
ETC_20180827_035012	Mushutas transformed from mushrooms grown in cold regions. In northern provinces of the Kingdom, local sayings warn against mushrooms grown under the aurora. Many believe these monsters appeared at the Starlit Lake due to its starlight-attracting properties.
ETC_20180827_035013	Trippy
ETC_20180827_035014	Most small Insect types exist in large numbers. Trippies are an exception, as their populations are smaller than those of similarly-sized species.
ETC_20180827_035015	Ice Tree
ETC_20180827_035016	A tree of ice.
ETC_20180827_035017	Froster Lord Reflection
ETC_20180827_035018	Vine Walker
ETC_20180827_035019	In the past, Nicopolis wizards grew these magic creatures by winding the springs on their backs to generate vines, which they used for gardening. After the accident of Nicopolis, however, they were affected by Medzio Diena and became the monsters they are today.
ETC_20180827_035020	Crescent Moya
ETC_20180827_035021	A few monster experiments created by the wizards of old Nicopolis have begun to reappear after Medzio Diena. Considering how commonly Moyas are used in experiments, Crescent Moyas are likely one of the species' many varieties.
ETC_20180827_035022	Wiza Moya
ETC_20180827_035023	Before their mysterious disappearance, the wizards of Nicopolis were known to conduct various experiments on monsters. One of those monsters was the species we now call Wiza Moya.
ETC_20180827_035024	Slime Witch
ETC_20180827_035025	Most of these monsters are old residents of Nicopolis who turned into slime. After a tragic experiment caused them all to disappear, Medzio Diena caused many to return to our world in the form of slime.
ETC_20180827_035026	Kindron Shooter
ETC_20180827_035027	Vesperia
ETC_20180827_035028	Vesperias are the last stage of development of their species. These monsters could have caused serious damage to the Resistance army, if it weren't for the Masters' timely support.
ETC_20180827_035029	Mimorat Purple
ETC_20180827_035030	For generations, the wizards of Nicopolis experimented with all sorts of magic creatures. Mimorats were the products of their first experiments on common rats.
ETC_20180827_035031	Mimorat White
ETC_20180827_035032	Mimorat Whites were created to carry goods on their backs. Even after the wizards of Nicopolis disappeared, these Mimorats survived and have since developed tastes of their own.
ETC_20180827_035033	Mimorat Pink
ETC_20180827_035034	Mimorat Pinks have evolved from Mimorat Whites according to the tastes of the species. Pinks like to collect and carry all sorts of objects, with some objects becoming more popular than others in light of the latest trends.
ETC_20180827_035035	Mimorat Green
ETC_20180827_035036	Greens suffered the most radical transformations out of all the Mimorats after Medzio Diena. There is no telling why some were more affected than others, especially considering that all Mimorats belong to the same species.
ETC_20180827_035037	Haunted House
ETC_20180827_035038	These creatures were created as prisons according to the tastes of Nicopolis wizards. They became abandoned after the great accident, then turned into the monsters they are today with the influence of Medzio Diena.
ETC_20180827_035039	Slime Wizard
ETC_20180827_035040	These Nicopolis wizards who disappeared after the great accident and returned to our world as slime also lost their arms in the process, so they created a pair of slime arms that move by telekinesis. After that, they continued to conduct experiments and managed to cause another major accident.
ETC_20180827_035041	Popup Cat
ETC_20180827_035042	These creatures originate from a failed experiment of a Nicopolis wizard who attempted to produce easy-to-read magic books. A cute mistake in the history of the city.
ETC_20180827_035043	Slime Gemini
ETC_20180827_035044	Slime Gemini are the product of a failed experiment by Nicopolis wizards who returned to our world as slime and attempted to regain their human form by cloning themselves. Most residents of Nicopolis who were lost in the great accident and reappeared after Medzio Diena aren't very pleasant to look at.
ETC_20180827_035045	Pervading Queen
ETC_20180827_035046	She was one of the three wizards who ruled Nicopolis. After eliminating the capital and the court with a magic that affects only living beings, her ambitious experiments failed and caused the disappearance of all the residents of Nicopolis. She remained dormant in the form of dead matter, until the events of Medzio Diena brought her back to life.

ETC_20180827_035761	I can't get up...
ETC_20180827_035762	I'm so dizzy. I'm gonna throw up...
ETC_20180827_035763	It felt so strange fighting those demons. Does that mean...
ETC_20180827_035764	If those were my own comrades I was fighting...
ETC_20180827_035765	... Blood was going to be shed either way. I'm ready for anything.
ETC_20180827_035766	N-no! I don't want to be a demon!
ETC_20180827_035767	I guess I'll never return to my family now...
ETC_20180827_035768	Why did it have to end like this... 
ETC_20180827_035769	It's all over now... There is no hope...
ETC_20180827_035770	It could be worse... I could be dead.
ETC_20180827_035771	You came. Commander Byle is over there.
ETC_20180827_035772	I'm on the lookout for potential demon attacks.
ETC_20180827_035773	Not that I think of it, it would be really helpful to have the Himil family on our side.
ETC_20180827_035774	Rumors say that something has happened in the family that's keeping them busy.
ETC_20180827_035775	If only Mechen hadn't made any mistakes, things wouldn't be so serious.
ETC_20180827_035776	It's all in the past now. I wonder what Mechen is up to nowadays?
ETC_20180827_035777	I'm monitoring the area, looking out for the enemy.
ETC_20180827_035778	The story of how Lydia Schaffen defeated Ziburynas at the forest is a very famous one.
ETC_20180827_035779	Ziburynas Forest has that name because that's where Ziburynas was defeated.
ETC_20180827_035780	Ignas is incredibly powerful now... I wonder if maybe he has the Essence of Ziburynas?
ETC_20180827_035781	We came all the way here, now all that's left is taking back the tower!
ETC_20180827_035782	For the forgotten glory of the Schaffenstar!
ETC_20180827_035783	Don't move! You'll get hurt.
ETC_20180827_035784	Those demons... I didn't know they would be this strong.
ETC_20180827_035785	Aaaaaah! Help!! It hurts!! 
ETC_20180827_035786	The demons are way too powerful, we can't beat them...
ETC_20180827_035787	Our members took great damage. We can't carry on like this...
ETC_20180827_035788	The demons might try to attack here, so I'm keeping watch.
ETC_20180827_035789	At least we have enough supplies on 21F...
ETC_20180827_035790	We're running a little short on arrows...

ETC_20180827_035830	Hm, I'm alright now!
ETC_20180827_035831	Ignas sold his soul to the demons. What he did can never be forgiven!

ETC_20180827_035866	Revelator. Thank you. Several Class Masters now have agreed to support us!
ETC_20180827_035867	I was extremely surprised when General Lhamin said he would join himself... I'm so glad!
ETC_20180827_035868	Hm, now that the Masters are helping us, we're well stocked up!
ETC_20180827_035869	All the new arrows and food rations we've received, it's all thanks to you.
ETC_20180827_035870	Don't get too comfortable. They may have retreated, but the enemy is still around. 
ETC_20180827_035871	Well, the tower's ours. We can relax now.
ETC_20180827_035872	We have restored the glory of the Great Lydia Schaffen.
ETC_20180827_035873	Yes! The tower's ours!{nl}Uugh. My stomach is wrecked from the nerves...
ETC_20180827_035874	Haha! I knew we could do it!
ETC_20180827_035875	It was a tough battle...
ETC_20180827_035876	Don't be too sure yet, there are still demons around.
ETC_20180827_035877	Don't get too smug. Just because we got Ignas, doesn't mean it's over.
ETC_20180827_035878	We're done! Ah. I can finally go back to my family.
ETC_20180827_035879	Idiot. Their troops are still running around.
ETC_20180827_035880	I'm glad it's over, but do I get to go on a pilgrimage now?
ETC_20180827_035881	Come to think about it, what happens to old man Henika now?
ETC_20180827_035882	We're supposed to be watching him for now.
ETC_20180827_035883	Well... I'm sure Commander Byle will have something to say when he gets here.
ETC_20180827_035884	Thank you... I can finally put my mind at ease...
ETC_20180827_035885	Come to think of it, I wonder how Adaux and his group made it back?
ETC_20180827_035886	I hope I never have to see my own colleagues suffer like that anymore.
ETC_20180827_035887	I will remember our efforts today for as long as I live.
ETC_20180827_035888	The noble sacrifices of our allies will not be in vain.
ETC_20180827_035889	I'm relieved that the tower is ours again, but my heart aches for those who had to be sacrificed...
ETC_20180827_035890	The Astral Tower is ours, we did it... but why can't I help these tears...
ETC_20180827_035891	Thank you! You are the reason the Astral Tower is with us again!
ETC_20180827_035892	It's a new beginning. For one, we will need to restore the tower.
ETC_20180827_035893	Now that we have the tower back, we're gonna need a new leader... Do you think the Himil family would give it a thought?
ETC_20180827_035894	Nah, they're pretty set on the whole Dragoon business. No way they would consider it.
ETC_20180827_035895	We've done it. Today we made history.
ETC_20180827_035896	I'm only sorry our colleagues who abandoned the tower couldn't be here with us.
ETC_20180827_035897	Do you think I can get some rest now? I was so scared by the attack earlier... sigh... You did well!
ETC_20180827_035898	When this is over, I want to visit Ziburynas Forest. Look back on the history of the Schaffenstar.
ETC_20180827_035899	When this is over, I ought to focus on training the new members.
ETC_20180827_035900	What Ignas did was shameless... But now the nightmare of the Astral Tower is over.
ETC_20180827_035901	Oh, Revelator! Thanks to you, we can finally be happy again!
ETC_20180827_035902	We took back the glory of the Schaffenstar, now it's time to restore it.
ETC_20180827_035903	I guess the fight is over now. Don't think anyone else is gonna get hurt... right?
ETC_20180827_035904	Sigh... I'm just glad everyone is safe from danger now.
ETC_20180827_035905	The Astral Tower is ours again... I'm happy these wounds were not in vain...
ETC_20180827_035906	You gave us hope when we most needed it. I am eternally grateful.
ETC_20180827_035907	Soon we can all put this tragedy behind our backs. Thank you.
ETC_20180827_035908	We should get these supplies back inside the tower now.
ETC_20180827_035909	Battle's over, but I still need to fight these boxes of supplies...
ETC_20180827_035910	Ah, Revelator. Thank you. We can finally be at ease.

ETC_20190104_036894	На протяжении тысяч лет мечники были основными пехотинцами Королевства и карьерой для начинающих авантюристов. Многие герои, поднявшиеся на большие высоты, начинали как мечники.  Несмотря на мириады достижений и тактик, используемых в войне, мечники всегда были незаменимым в активом бою.{nl}Классы в дереве мечника имеют самый высокий уровень жизни (HP) и защиты (DEF) и все классы могут умело обращаться с оружием в самом сердце битвы.
ETC_20190104_036895	Since their part in King Zachariel's war, Highlanders have been acting as Royal Guards for the aristocrats, protecting the palace and major cities of the Kingdom. To this day they act as the Special Forces of the Royal Military and have suffered a huge loss in the Fallen City during Medzio Diena.{nl}Highlanders are fearsome warriors famous for their expertise with two-handed swords that push enemies into each other and other objects on the field of battle.
ETC_20190104_036896	Throughout the history of the Kingdom, the Peltasta has acted as the King's personal soldiers.

ETC_20190104_036897	Hoplites were formed when the Kingdom began to invite outside specialists into their army.

Hoplite Masters are elected from retired Hoplites.{nl}Hoplites are expert spearsmen with extended range and receive bonus damage when standing off against larger enemies.
ETC_20190104_036898	Barbarians were once warriors hailing from a far away continent, but they have now been fully assimilated into the Kingdom.

Barbarian legends claim that they were the original natives of the Kingdom before they migrated.{nl}Barbarians are aggressive warriors who will do anything for victory. 
ETC_20190104_036899	Mounted troops are difficult to train and, because of this reason, they receive special treatment from the Kingdom. Masters that serve actively as soldiers are such a case. Mounted troops usually consist of nobilities and aristocrats. Even if they are not an official part of the Royal Army, they are given the same treatment.{nl}Cataphracts are mounted warriors that bravely charge into enemy lines.

Most Doppelsoeldner have either integrated the Pledge of the Blade or work actively as mercenaries.{nl}The Doppelsoeldner are mercenaries that will willingly risk their own lives for financial gain. They leave themselves open to enemy attacks in order to strike back harder or gain extra benefits.
ETC_20190104_036901	The shield and the sword have been a standard part of military training for many years. Soldiers equipped with a sword and shield are difficult to take down but once their formation is broken a big loss is suffered. The Rodeleros are special forces of the Royal Military formed in order to keep soldiers' formations in line.{nl}The Rodelero specializes in ambushing and nullifying the enemy forces through ambushes. Their use of the shield makes them effective units against ranged attacks.
ETC_20190104_036902	As gladiators, the Murmillo are not a formal military occupation but nor are they looked down upon by those in the regular forces.  The Murmillo have been taking part in gladiatorial battles for 900 years since the days of King Melkhiel.{nl}The Murmillo are gladiators that have balanced offense and defense. They offer sturdy ranged defense with Cassis Crista or reinforced shield-based skills.
ETC_20190104_036903	The weapons that the nobility could carry with them within the Royal Palaces had been heavily restricted during the War of the 3rd Succession.

ETC_20190104_036904	The Dragoons were first formed when the Himil family left the Schaffenstar.

They are the most effective when using two-handed spears.
ETC_20190104_036905	Templars are former clergymen that have been secularized to answer directly to the King during the reign of King Rael. They became renown for their services during the War of the 2nd Succession where they fought fiercely in support of King Gliehel. Because of this, the Templars are given authority over all other military personnel by law during times of war.
ETC_20190104_036906	Lancers are made up of noblemen and also are the main forces in the Royal Army. They suffered heavy damage during Medzio Diena as they were stationed near the Royal Palace. Because of this, they are currently the rarest of all military units at the moment.{nl}Lancers are mounted units that are highly effective against footmen.

ETC_20191024_042686	Misrus	머즈루스
ETC_20191024_042687	Misrus had been isolated in the Outer Wall Sewers since Medzio Diena. According to a diary of a dead Schaffenstar member found in the sewers, the Chesha had been fearful of Misrus but did not run away as if something even greater than Misrus was keeping them trapped in the sewers. Whatever that creature may be, it must be at least a demon lord or something even greater.	머즈루스는 신수의 날 이후 누군가에 의해 외성벽 지하수로에 격리되어있었습니다. 그곳에서 발견된 죽은 샤펜스타 단원의 일지로 추측해보면, 체샤들은 머즈루스를 매우 두려워하면서도 아무도 도망치려고 하지 않았습니다. 별다른 수단도 없이 머즈루스와 체샤들을 그 어둡고 음산한 공간에 가둬 둘 수 있는 존재는 누구였을지 모르지만, 머즈루스의 흉포함만 보더라도 그 존재가 가볍게 무시할 수 있는 인물은 아니라는 생각이 듭니다. 수북이 쌓인 뼈 무더기들을 밝고 서 있는 두 머리의 짐승 앞에서 떨지 않을 수 있는 건 마왕, 혹은 그보다 더 강한 존재들뿐입니다.
