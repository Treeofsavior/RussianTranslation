QUEST_20150317_000676	The Report of the High Barrier Magic
QUEST_20150317_000677	The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord alone.
QUEST_20150317_000678	It acts like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.

QUEST_20150317_000684	The mana provided to use barrier magic wasn't voluntary. {nl}We theorize that the levels of the Demon Lords were divided and sealed into the foundation stones and aligned into a position.
QUEST_20150317_000685	The key to unlock this barrier is in the foundation. {nl}We'll continue to search for the answer after we block Helgasercle's invasion.
QUEST_20150317_000686	The Understanding of Mana
QUEST_20150317_000687	Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
QUEST_20150317_000688	Okay so, what is mana? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. It doesn't just imply the length of lives.
QUEST_20150317_000689	The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
QUEST_20150317_000690	The Diary of Antares' Investigation
QUEST_20150317_000691	As I was investigating mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Mage Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower
QUEST_20150317_000692	After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types of mana we know of, and it has a shape of a specific object.
QUEST_20150317_000693	This object must be from the era of Agailla Flurry as no one knows the existence of this object.
QUEST_20150317_000694	I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the highest place atop the tower, we have no way to reach it.
QUEST_20150317_000695	We can't demolish the tower nor destroy part of it just to get it.
QUEST_20150317_000696	I will end my writing by stating that this object has more to be investigated.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	This is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue was built.
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
QUEST_20150317_001086	In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of silver coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of silver coins from creditors.
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the goddess herself takes the silver,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer silver coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops silver coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.
QUEST_20150317_001093	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? {nl}{nl}Would you return them to me?{nl}I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'
QUEST_20150317_001094	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. {nl}After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste, but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001096	Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
QUEST_20150317_001100	Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.
QUEST_20150317_001101	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money.
QUEST_20150317_001102	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'
QUEST_20150317_001103	Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.
QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.
QUEST_20150317_001105	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'
QUEST_20150317_001106	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'
QUEST_20150317_001107	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'
QUEST_20150317_001108	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'
QUEST_20150317_001109	The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.
QUEST_20150317_001110	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at Zemyna's Goddess Statue. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, Goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.
QUEST_20150317_001111	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have you come to take back what you have lost?'
QUEST_20150317_001112	Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.
QUEST_20150317_001113	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what you're asking of me is not by a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits for those who do not work.'
QUEST_20150317_001114	But I worked very hard today!'
QUEST_20150317_001115	I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'
QUEST_20150317_001116	The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found silver coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the silver before leaving.
QUEST_20150317_001117	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'
QUEST_20150317_001118	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that, she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001119	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'
QUEST_20150317_001120	Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.
QUEST_20150317_001121	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried for him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'
QUEST_20150317_001122	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'
QUEST_20150317_001123	Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.
QUEST_20150317_001124	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.
QUEST_20150317_001125	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'
QUEST_20150317_001126	Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.
QUEST_20150317_001127	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.
QUEST_20150317_001128	The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of silver coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
QUEST_20150317_001129	For a beggar who had been stingy over a single silver coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
QUEST_20150317_001130	The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to silver coins.
QUEST_20150317_001131	The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
QUEST_20150317_001132	A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.
QUEST_20150317_001133	After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that silver no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of silver, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001134	After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
QUEST_20150317_001135	The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a large statue dedicated to her.
QUEST_20150317_001136	On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the silver coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
QUEST_20150317_001137	After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost silver coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20150317_001138	Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001139	The Gambler of Klaipeda
QUEST_20150317_001140	The Gambler of Klaipeda {nl}~A Short Story~
QUEST_20150317_001141	{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
QUEST_20150317_001143	Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
QUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
QUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
QUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.
QUEST_20150317_001147	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If it works, this'll certainly be the most pleasant, risk-free way to wealth.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.
QUEST_20150317_001149	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'
QUEST_20150317_001150	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'
QUEST_20150317_001151	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - that won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'
QUEST_20150317_001152	'No. No matter how unlucky things may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'
QUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win some, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'
QUEST_20150317_001155	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You'll start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001156	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.
QUEST_20150317_001157	'After I win, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object; instead, he thought of victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.
QUEST_20150317_001158	As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
QUEST_20150317_001159	Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001160	However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001161	Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001162	'Are you not busy? You seemed to be in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl}Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another ten minutes or so. This horse might not look like much, but when it comes down to it, he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001163	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl}'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl}{nl}Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl}'Do you not believe what I just said, or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl}A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl}'No, I didn't mean it like that...' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001164	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl}{nl}Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150317_001165	Considering Modestas' habit, to not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl}'What... What kind of bet?' {nl}'We're going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl}Modestas desperately fought against his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150317_001166	On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001167	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts, it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150317_001168	For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001169	Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more silver than he started with.
QUEST_20150317_001170	While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001171	'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl}Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl}Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl}'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001172	Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001173	What started as trivial banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001174	The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a large amount of money in this bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001175	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his own favorite goddess. {nl}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl}There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001176	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}The soldiers then resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001177	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him. {nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001178	In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001179	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join. Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001180	In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001181	If you think about it, even if it was not his turn to lose, all it took for him do so was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{nl}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001182	The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001183	Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001184	Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001185	If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001186	Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001187	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down, hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001188	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe, with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001189	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas needed the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone, but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001190	Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001191	The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001192	Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001193	In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001194	Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a silver nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of silver, but of lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001195	'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001196	Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001197	Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a large amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001199	However, right as the bet was settled, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and, in a moment, clearly became gold. {nl}The Old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget. Be sure to bring it.' {nl}Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001200	Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001201	Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001202	'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest - well maybe not the richest - but a wealthy man at the least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001203	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The deep, heavy voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas, in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001204	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land, for my sierra stretches far. Further in me, I contain large, valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001205	Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001206	For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001207	At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a large boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001208	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed. {nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150317_001209	'Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to its former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance just to win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself by knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001210	And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001211	Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too large for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001212	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet - the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman questioned Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001213	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits; instead he was in debt, wasted all his chances to win, and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman responded flatly, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble, but he was not the type to throw a tantrum, nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150317_001214	Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001215	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but for my amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001216	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001217	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150317_001218	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001219	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001220	The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001221	The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl}Modestas was very grateful for the help. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he had lost earlier against.
QUEST_20150317_001222	To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl}The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
QUEST_20150317_001223	Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl}The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001224	Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the large open space at the center of town. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001225	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys.{nl}To the Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001226	Everyone who was there favored the idea on the spot. {nl}The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Commander and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001227	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001228	The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl}Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the goddesses in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001229	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001230	However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the goddess whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001231	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001232	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001233	Ever since then, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing: the answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl} {nl}But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years, and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001234	Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, he had never bet anything other than the goddess' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001235	In the end, this unknown goddess, in exchange for giving a livelihood to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, created an interesting, mysterious, yet beautiful statue for the city of Klaipeda, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_20150323_001435	It could be the one who stole the gypsum carving of the Goddess Statue, so get rid of the monsters there. {nl}If my hunch is right, then Naktis must be behind it. {nl} It might be far away, but I just heard that.

QUEST_20150323_001446	Those brothers are crazy. They must be completely nuts. {nl}When did it start? When Dora attacked Gracius? {nl}When they saw the demons marching?
QUEST_20150323_001447	Things have gone to hell since Gracius was incapacitated. {nl}From the very beginning, while I kept my mouth shut, everyone lusted for bloodshed. {nl}The town was like a volcano waiting to erupt. {nl}I thought it was an educational experience until then.
QUEST_20150323_001448	Then something snapped. {nl}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one could remember why they wanted to become a priest anymore.
QUEST_20150323_001449	This surely is not a teaching of Sir Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing one another, 'teaching a lesson'? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.
QUEST_20150323_001450	I can hear snickering somewhere. {nl}It could be the sound of Dora deceiving me. {nl}It doesn't really matter any more.
QUEST_20150323_001451	The trapped spirit gave you a scripture and disappeared.
QUEST_20150323_001452	You endured Witas' curse thanks to the medicine.
QUEST_20150323_001453	If you ever see the Devout Tree, please bring it back to life. {nl}I've heard that tree can block the power of the curse.
QUEST_20150323_001454	I believe that the evil will eventually fall and the goddess will be victorious. {nl}The mark of victory is right in front of me.

QUEST_20150323_001463	The Tree Root Crystals of Pilgrim's Way are cursed by Naktis, {nl}as if to mock Sir Maven's teachings against laziness. 
QUEST_20150323_001464	It should be destroyed before the curse spreads. {nl}However, I cannot handle the Tree Root Crystals alone. 
QUEST_20150323_001465	Souls of Pilgrims swallowed by the monsters can destroy the Tree Root Crystal. {nl}Maybe I, too, will be one of them soon.
QUEST_20150323_001466	Notice for Pilgrims

QUEST_20150323_001656	Growing these will use up parts of the cultivated farm however. {nl}The landlord of the farm in the reservoir area, Shaton, {nl}is here just in time so I should try persuading him while I can.

QUEST_20150323_001665	Well, I've made some mistakes here and there but who doesn't? {nl}I mean, just look at grapes. How can you use water without wine mixed as drinking water? {nl}Even if the world is ending, you can't just drink plain water. That's barbaric! {nl}Hmm! Anyway, I appreciate the help.

QUEST_20150323_001669	Think about it, it may have been a warning about those poisonous grapes. {nl}The true gold blessing will come after the blue disaster passes.

QUEST_20150714_002066	How could this happen?! {nl}Lydia Schaffen is aiding Kadumel's forces!
QUEST_20150714_002067	Lydia Schaffen, a person I've only heard of in rumors, came to the city with her followers. {nl}The officers and soldiers expect she'll change the tide of the battle. {nl}His Majesty ordered us to support her to the best of our ability.
QUEST_20150714_002068	Commander Ruklys has fallen in battle, and the Fortress of the Land has been taken. {nl}Some people say he was killed by Lydia Schaffen's arrow,{nl}while others say by the royal magicians' magic. {nl}{nl}It is indeed sad news.

QUEST_20150714_002078	Those soldiers of the Royal Army! Especially Premier Eminent! {nl}They're no different from demons. Even the goddesses would not forgive them.
QUEST_20150714_002079	I don't want to die. {nl}We were just following the goddesses' words. {nl}Everyone is killing each other in the names of the goddesses. {nl}Who has deceived us? {nl}

QUEST_20150714_002093	I've studied magic for a long time as a sorcerer. {nl}From the process, the advancement of sorcery can't be explained without relating with demons, {nl}and since they've fought against the goddesses, {nl}the field has been widened to the study of the goddesses as well.
QUEST_20150714_002094	While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.
QUEST_20150714_002095	Records about Disciple Laius
QUEST_20150714_002096	My other disciple, Laius, is clever and a fast learner but has an insatiable greed for knowledge. {nl}I am worried that he may fail the task. {nl}A scholar should always try to learn, but obsessing about it will make one walk the wrong path.
QUEST_20150714_002097	Despite that, Laius is a disciple I acknowledge. {nl}His passion towards me and knowledge is just being expressed in a wrong way.

QUEST_20150714_002102	Records of the Hidden Object
QUEST_20150714_002103	...I don't know whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or not. My greed for knowledge can ruin the world.
QUEST_20150714_002104	I can't sleep well for fear of my research results being spread by demon investigation. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
QUEST_20150714_002105	The Inheritance of the Master
QUEST_20150714_002106	As the priests and theologians know, Goddess Vaivora is in charge of the library,{nl}where all records of the world are stored. I was able to check several records in that {nl}fantastic library after the research and long studying I can't tell anyone about at the moment. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002107	From the many records of the goddess, I was only able to see a few. {nl}Nevertheless, the fact that I checked the existence of the records with the important facts {nl}was astonishing. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002108	The record which I can use to find the whereabouts of all the goddesses... {nl}If one had such secret information, it would be possible to predict the goddesses' {nl}future locations by analyzing what they did in the past. {nl}Because of that, their future plans may be disturbed or put at risk. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002109	This is more dangerous because, if the demons find out the truth, {nl}their desire for the library will grow and, if they do acquire that knowledge, {nl}the world will be swallowed by evil. That's why - {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002110	(The rest is blurred and unreadable.)
QUEST_20150714_002111	Disciple Hones' Memo
QUEST_20150714_002112	If you want to find the master's research, you have to find three spatial magic stones {nl}and activate the fusion device.
QUEST_20150714_002113	The Spatial Magic Gem of Contract is at the reception room. {nl}The monsters probably have the fragments. {nl}Collect all the fragments of the magical stones and go to the{nl}preserved magic circle in the Grave of the Saints to restore them.
QUEST_20150714_002114	The Spatial Magic Gem of Offer is with the Templeshooter. {nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you find the hidden Templeshooter.
QUEST_20150714_002115	The Spatial Magic Gem of Promise can be found in Siaura Mine. {nl}Use the Soul Crystal on the monsters first to collect their Condensed Spite. {nl}With that, destroy the stones in Siaura Mine. {nl}Black Chasers will pursue from behind, avoid them and go to the end of the mine{nl}to find the magic gem.
QUEST_20150714_002116	When you find all three spatial magic gems, go to the fusion device again,{nl}and place the magic gems there. {nl}The path to the master's research will then open at the Laudi Tower.
QUEST_20150714_002117	Spirit

QUEST_20150714_002121	The Pot of Silence is at Memum Corridor... {nl}I'm so... exhausted...
QUEST_20150714_002122	Where to start...
QUEST_20150714_002123	I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002124	That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}She must've thought she didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002125	I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples... {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
QUEST_20150714_002126	I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002127	But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. {nl}Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my,{nl}and Archon's spirit to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002128	As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002129	I've been tied here for hundreds of years... {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
QUEST_20150714_002130	The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.
QUEST_20150714_002131	Memorial Stone
QUEST_20150714_002132	By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002133	By my name, Valius, the one who walks the way of Linker, {nl}I swear that I will not surrender to the demons.
QUEST_20150714_002134	I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
QUEST_20150714_002135	Records of Investigation
QUEST_20150714_002136	The basics of Linker magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002137	I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic,{nl}and magical power somewhat.{nl}But now, at last it is possible to accept Linker Magic even without magical ability.{nl}
QUEST_20150714_002138	Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002139	If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician,{nl}within a short period of time.
QUEST_20150714_002140	This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle,{nl}who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
QUEST_20150714_002141	However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.
QUEST_20150714_002142	Design Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002143	The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction requires a considerable amount of magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002144	Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction {nl}with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, {nl}it won't last long.
QUEST_20150714_002145	Adrijus' Notice Board
QUEST_20150714_002146	I am looking for a stone rubbing of the tablet at the central sanctum. {nl}If you find any tablets with writings engraved, make a rubbing off of it. {nl}- Adrijus
QUEST_20150714_002147	Stained Tablet
QUEST_20150714_002148	It seems that someone has already made a rubbing since there is a vague trace of ink. {nl}Shall I read it?
QUEST_20150714_002149	King Kadumel finally dies.
QUEST_20150714_002150	Instead of the Mage Tower, the Tower of Fire would be a more fitting name for Flurry's tower.
QUEST_20150714_002151	This is a very secluded area so monsters usually prey around here. {nl}Be careful around here.
QUEST_20150714_002152	Research Records of Demetrius
QUEST_20150714_002153	In ancient times, humans lived with the goddesses. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, {nl}I thought it was made up out of respect for the goddesses. {nl}{nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence, {nl}as well as why this myth was created.
QUEST_20150714_002154	I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I traveled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather {nl}than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
QUEST_20150714_002155	The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, {nl}all humans used to live with the goddesses underground. {nl}I suppose the goddesses used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
QUEST_20150714_002156	This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, {nl}and more fables would have been created as a result.
QUEST_20150714_002157	I believe the goddesses erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist {nl}due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great goddesses.
QUEST_20150714_002158	And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons{nl}may exist underground. {nl}{nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts {nl}that are recorded in history and the present.
QUEST_20150714_002159	I can smell many Avietes. I heard they're effective... Could you share them with us?
QUEST_20150714_002160	Thank you. I will give you as many as you need. {nl}You will be successful.

QUEST_20150714_002167	I guess I'll take this tombstone rubbing to the person who wants it.
QUEST_20150714_002168	Since I've already made the rubbing, I'll give it to the person who wants it.

QUEST_20150714_002192	The Basics of Ignition
QUEST_20150714_002193	Ignition differs by elements, but with the blessing from the goddess, there may be cases where we can ignore that. {nl}To do so, we should try hard to achieve the scholarly knowledge and the faithfulness to the goddesses.

QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the silver coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your silver coins here.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a second pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue of Goddess Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost silver coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some silver. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	As the silversmith held out his silver coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost silver, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra silver.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	The orchard owner took out a large amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the silver coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost silver.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's silver and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your silver coins too.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my silver. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002334	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337	'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002339	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342	'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343	Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150729_002346	Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What...  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150729_002347	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348	As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349	You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350	What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353	When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
QUEST_20150729_002357	Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358	If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359	However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363	Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002364	And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365	This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain large valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a large quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150729_002369	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377	Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380	Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383	And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the Goddess Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other goddesses stem from, Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384	In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful Goddess Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}

QUEST_20160224_003627	Book written in Runic Characters
QUEST_20160224_003628	This is a story about the nearly forgotten runic characters.{nl}Runic characters had been used since before the foundation of the kingdom by smaller northern tribes.{nl}Peculiarly, these people believed that the characters held magical powers.{nl}That's the reason why the northern people spent a long time to find those powers.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003629	Finally, a person was able to find the powers dwelling in the runic characters.{nl}They do not have any powers by themselves, but they are a channel for powers that can only be manifested through them...{nl}That was the secret behind the runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003630	He went straight to Goddess Saule and told her of the hidden powers of the runic characters, and the goddess rejoiced and blessed him.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003631	People came to call him a 'Rune Caster'.{nl}He became the first Rune Caster Master and fostered many more Rune Casters.{nl}He also created the Rune Stone so that the new Rune Casters would easily be able to use runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003632	One day, he vanished leaving only his Rune Stone behind.{nl}The Rune Stone he left behind has become a symbol of the way of the Rune Caster and has been passed down from master to master.
QUEST_20160224_003633	People often say that the goddesses are always with us.{nl}This is right not only in a spiritual sense but also a practical sense.{nl}That's because it symbolizes the fact that the goddesses are tending over us from their abodes.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003634	{nl}For instance, it is said that Goddess Vaivora manages a massive library only permitted to the goddesses.{nl}This library is also the dwelling place of Goddess Vaivora.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003635	{nl}Another example is the residence of Goddess Jurate which is rumored to be on a mysterious sea where human ships cannot reach.{nl}They say that a ship larger than most islands is the residence of Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003636	{nl}It is said that even Goddess Vakarine that goes around numerous locations has her own abode.{nl}Some say that there is a demon prison in a dimension that we do not know of, and that is the domain of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}But that is only one of the many locations that Goddess Vakarine visits.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003637	{nl}There are also legends that Goddess Laima has a palace deep underground where nobody knows of.{nl}There is no way to find it, it is also said that the Demon Goddess Giltine also resides there.
QUEST_20160224_003638	The Rune Stone...{nl}I haven't heard of that in a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003639	In the past, I've met a person that was searching for the {nl}special powers hidden within the runic characters.{nl}He was filled with a pure passion for the task.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003640	He eventually found the hidden powers in the runic characters and became the first Rune Caster.{nl}A channel for power... The power of the runic characters was their {nl}ability to allow the casters to realized their strength through them.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003641	He crafted a Rune Stone to let others use the powers of the Rune Stone with easier access.{nl}Although his Rune Stone was nothing extraordinary, the following generations of {nl}Rune Caster Masters have carefully guarded his Rune Stone out of respect...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003642	Unfortunately his Rune Stone was lost during the Petrified City incident.{nl}That is why the Rune Caster Master is still looking for his Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003643	The fact that you've come to me with knowledge of the Rune Stone... {nl}Perhaps it means that you were led here by its powers.
QUEST_20160224_003644	Yes. Although it is an old tale...{nl}I do have an idea of where the Rune Stone may be.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003645	The last place I sensed the Rune Stone was at the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}But that was a long time ago... I don't recall exactly where I sensed it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003646	I remember the traveler that came to me asking for a blessing a few hundred years ago.{nl}He said that he had seen a mysterious stone with {nl}strange characters engraved on it near a waterfall.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003647	Unfortunately I was not able to know about what was occurring{nl}around the world after I had resolved to protect the revelation.{nl}Perhaps humans may know more about the whereabouts of the Rune Stone than I do.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003648	Yes. Maybe a human family that has survived for a long time such as the Jonas family...{nl}Someone that has eternal life like the Amjinas is sure to know something.
QUEST_20160224_003649	You mentioned 'Rune Stone', didn't you?{nl}Ah, could it be...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003650	If you are talking about a stone with strange characters engraved on it, yes I do have one.{nl}I don't know how long it has been, but it has been in {nl}the possession of the Jonas family for generations.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003651	But it is treated as rubbish since there is no way of knowing what it is used for.{nl}Now I know it is Rune Stone thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003652	Why are you searching for it though?
QUEST_20160224_003653	I see.{nl}It is useless in our hands, so we'll give it to you if you absolutely need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003654	No matter how valuable an object may be, {nl}it has to be in the hands of someone that needs it to be worth anything.
QUEST_20160224_003655	You've come here in search of the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003656	I don't know where you've heard of it, but I do have one.{nl}I threw a tantrum when I was young to get it when {nl}it was gifted to the Winterspoon family long ago.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003657	Though, that's already a few hundred years ago.{nl}Now where did I put it...
QUEST_20160224_003658	Oh, as it happens, I have it right here.{nl}I have no use for it, so you may have it if you need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003659	It may have been destined for you since you are the first person {nl}to seek something that nobody wanted for hundreds of years.{nl}As a handler of time, I am thinking that perhaps it was a future promised in the past.
QUEST_20160224_003660	I can't seem to find where I've put it.{nl}I'll keep an eye out for it, so would you mind coming back later?
QUEST_20160224_003661	Do you mean the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003662	I don't have anything like that...{nl}But I do have something that comes to mind.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003663	There is a place in West Siauliai Woods that cannot be accessed through ordinary means.{nl}I had faintly sensed a mysterious aura for a few hundred years...{nl}But I couldn't find a way to get there.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003664	Perhaps the item you are searching for may be there.{nl}How about taking a look if you know how to get there?
QUEST_20160224_003665	Do you know that there is a place in West Siauliai Woods {nl}that cannot be accessed by ordinary means?{nl}I had sensed a mysterious aura there for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003666	I don't know how to get there, or what to expect to find there.{nl}You might be able to find something if you find a way to get there.
QUEST_20160224_003667	Rune Stone
QUEST_20160224_003668	(Unrecognizable characters are glowing.)
QUEST_20160224_003669	(It seems as if you require more Rune Stones.)
QUEST_20160224_003670	Something glowing seems to be embedded behind the tombstone.{nl}Take it out?
QUEST_20160224_003671	You can see many interesting things if you sit here.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003672	Not too long ago, a lady that seemed to be a mage came to ask something strange.{nl}I think she was looking for a stone engraved with characters that glow blue or something?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003673	I said I didn't know anything of the sort since I have never seen anything similar.{nl}She said something about going somewhere past Escanciu Village... I can't quite recall.
QUEST_20160224_003674	Rune Caster Master
QUEST_20160224_003675	Eh? Why am I sensing rune powers in you?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003676	Goodness! {nl}That is the Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master, isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003677	How did you manage to find it?{nl}I've been looking all over for it...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003678	That Rune Stone... Could you give it to me, please?{nl}Although it may not mean too much to ordinary people, {nl}it means a lot to Rune Caster Masters.
QUEST_20160224_003679	Thank you so much.{nl}The Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master is finally back in {nl}the hands of Rune Casters after hundreds of years thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003680	I don't know if it is sufficient as a reward, but let me teach you a little about runic characters.{nl}While extremely rare, there are some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003681	Perhaps if your magic is compatible with the runic characters...{nl}You may be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003682	No, I am certain that you will be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}I think that the will of the runic characters led you here to me.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003683	Rune Casters can cast powerful magic through Rune Stones.{nl}However, it does take a long time to gather the required magic.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003684	Oh... Have I been talking too much about Rune Casters?{nl}My bad, but thank you so much for finding the Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003685	Come back to me if you wish to become a Rune Caster.{nl}

QUEST_20160224_003714	There is almost nothing known about the Istora Ruins.{nl}The fact that they were discovered thanks to being pushed up after Medzio Diena is about it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003715	Then some adventures came to know about the Earth Tower here.{nl}It won't even open unless you are a Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003716	That's why we're making a living selling various of items to Revelators.{nl}Since only Revelators can carry relics from inside the tower.

QUEST_20160811_004191	I met this person wearing some funny-looking clothes the other day and they had one too.{nl}Looks like they came from outside of the kingdom...{nl}
QUEST_20160811_004192	They said something about what they were doing but I can't remember what.{nl}They were headed to the bee farm though?

QUEST_20160811_004200	{nl}The way they worship the goddesses may be a little different, but taking over the monastery...{nl}I don't think the monks are lying, but I can't believe that.
QUEST_20160811_004201	My friend is not one to tell lies.
QUEST_20160811_004202	{nl}Someone who believes in good would never take over a monastery and expel the monks.{nl}I'll take my friend's word and cancel this pilgrimage.
QUEST_20160811_004203	We came all the way here, so we'll keep heading to the monastery for now.{nl}The Order of the Tree of Truth I know wouldn't harm us.

QUEST_20160811_004212	I don't know why I'm so tired. Are you okay?{nl}Usually this place would be filled with monsters?
QUEST_20160811_004213	{nl}Not anymore though.{nl}Ever since the Order of the Tree of Truth put that black crystal there, they don't even dare to come near.
QUEST_20160811_004214	{nl}The crystal is a relic from the Divine Tree, they say.{nl}Seeing how the monsters won't even dare to come close, I'd say they're right.
QUEST_20160811_004215	I do feel a little sluggish... but the people from the Order said not to worry.{nl}It's all part of receiving the blessing of the Divine Tree, they said.
QUEST_20160811_004216	{nl}There's nothing to worry about if we just listen to them...{nl}Truth is, nothing they said so far is wrong.

QUEST_20160811_004221	High Officer Domantas
QUEST_20160811_004222	You. I remember you. Said your name was Stella, was it?{nl}You ought to convert to the Divine Tree already if you don't want to end up like the others.
QUEST_20160811_004223	{nl}You may have been innocent yourself, but the monastery was corrupt.{nl}Do you deny that there were demons among you?
QUEST_20160811_004224	{nl}Let's not be stubborn now. That helper your brought won't be of any use to you.{nl}I trust that you know what I'm capable of by now.
QUEST_20160811_004225	I remember the day you mercilessly slaughtered my brothers very well indeed.
QUEST_20160811_004226	{nl}I have but three things to tell you.{nl}One, I will never abandon the teachings of the goddess.
QUEST_20160811_004227	{nl}Two, the person next to me is not a common traveler, but a Revelator.
QUEST_20160811_004228	{nl}Three, the real demons are hiding among you!{nl}Allow me to prove it.
QUEST_20160811_004229	Mattas, what happened?{nl}You... you converted to the Order of the Tree of Truth?
QUEST_20160811_004230	I'm deeply ashamed... But I had no other choice.{nl}They captured us and kept us starved?
QUEST_20160811_004231	{nl}The pain was unimaginable.{nl}It was as if my entire body was burning down?
QUEST_20160811_004232	{nl}I realize there are still brothers who refuse to surrender.{nl}My words must sound like an excuse.
QUEST_20160811_004233	{nl}However... They're not just starving them, they're threatening their own lives!
QUEST_20160811_004234	{nl}When the goddesses themselves show no signs of returning, there is no hope whatsoever.
QUEST_20160811_004235	You're wrong.{nl}The goddesses will shine the light of salvation upon us.
QUEST_20160811_004236	{nl}I have with me a Revelator.{nl}Leave behind your past mistakes and help us take back the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004237	What did you say?{nl}This is... a Revelator?
QUEST_20160811_004238	{nl}That means we have a real chance of expelling the Order from the monastery!{nl}
QUEST_20160811_004239	Please, let me help.{nl}I shall pay for my sin after we recover the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004240	Very well. However...{nl}Did you happen to see the keeper of the monastery keys among the brothers who escaped?
QUEST_20160811_004241	I did see them, but...{nl}To tell you the truth about what happened... I'm very sorry.
QUEST_20160811_004242	{nl}The keeper was taken by High Officer Medea and lost their life.{nl}The keys are with Medeja now, I'm afraid.
QUEST_20160811_004243	{nl}Medea was here on duty at the time, unfortunately.
QUEST_20160811_004244	{nl}She specializes in hallucinations.{nl}She can make others see what she wants, I imagine that's why she was working outside the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004245	{nl}She did say, however, that she had been sent by the High Officer of an organization above the Order.{nl}The strong divine energy of the monastery was interfering with their power; she came to suppress it.
QUEST_20160811_004246	{nl}High Officer Domantas is also attempting to contaminate the energy of the monastery.{nl}They both want to suppress its divine power.
QUEST_20160811_004247	{nl}I was called for this very same task and was reporting to them the locations where the energy is strongest.
QUEST_20160811_004248	It's a shame to see such a kind person gone...{nl}But this is not the time to commiserate.
QUEST_20160811_004249	{nl}We must stop Medea's cruel deeds and take back the keys to the monastery.{nl}Brother Mattas. How can we lure Medea?
QUEST_20160811_004250	Destroying the energy suppressing devices as you intended is likely the best way to go about it.{nl}There are more in Rijekavi Fields and Krasjia Hill.
QUEST_20160811_004251	{nl}Go and destroy both devices.{nl}I'll stay with Medea and convince her to take matters into her own hands.
QUEST_20160811_004252	{nl}May the divine grace of the goddesses be with you both.
QUEST_20160811_004253	You're very hardworking.{nl}Managed to get the last device in the end.
QUEST_20160811_004254	{nl}You seem uncertain.{nl}There should be nothing more to hide now, should there?
QUEST_20160811_004255	Did you not hear about my specialty?{nl}That's a shame. The one called Stella is already under my power.
QUEST_20160811_004256	{nl}She's rather popular with the monks, isn't she?{nl}Having her surrender will do wonders in converting them.{nl}Do you see? This was all to get to you both.
QUEST_20160811_004257	{nl}I heard you defeated Domantas. Not quite the commoner, are you?{nl}And yet, you were no match for my wits.
QUEST_20160811_004258	{nl}You have no choice now but to become a loyal puppet of our Order.{nl}When my superiors see your talent, losing one or two devices will be nothing but a minor concern to them.
QUEST_20160811_004259	{nl}Now, convert to the Order.
QUEST_20160811_004260	Not a weak mind, I see, you can even move inside that magic circle.{nl}But then, I'd already figured that from the way you refused my kind proposal. I guess you've made your mind, then?
QUEST_20160811_004261	The magic circle is activated.{nl}Fortunately we have brother Mattas watching out for us.
QUEST_20160811_004262	{nl}Let's head to the monastery now.
QUEST_20160811_004263	It seems, not enough demons have been defeated to satisfy the dead.
QUEST_20160811_004264	High Officer Deimantas
QUEST_20160811_004265	Well look who we have here.{nl}If it isn't Stella, head of the monastery library!
QUEST_20160811_004266	{nl}I heard a lot about you from the other monks. Nice to finally meet you.{nl}I figured you would do anything to come back, from the things I heard.
QUEST_20160811_004267	{nl}Are you perhaps here to rescue the brothers?{nl}Seeing how you broke the barrier, you seem not just brave but rather clever as well.
QUEST_20160811_004268	{nl}I'm afraid your brothers will soon join our Order, however.{nl}And you will be next, of course. The question is whether we need to force you or not.
QUEST_20160811_004269	{nl}The so-called Revelator you brought along has hurt my kin and can therefore not be spared, but you...{nl}I am giving you a final chance.
QUEST_20160811_004270	{nl}Be reborn under the Order of the Tree of Truth.
QUEST_20160811_004271	You are not mere believers of another form of faith.
QUEST_20160811_004272	{nl}You are an abomination.{nl}Do not try to hide the fact that it's the demons who are behind you.
QUEST_20160811_004273	{nl}I am aware that you yourself are a demon.{nl}Know that for as long as we live, neither I nor the Revelator will ever abandon the grace of the goddesses.
QUEST_20160811_004274	{nl}Leave our monastery and release our brothers immediately!
QUEST_20160811_004275	It that your final choice?{nl}The noble martyr?
QUEST_20160811_004276	{nl}As you wish. We have plenty of talent.{nl}No need to insist any more with you.
QUEST_20160811_004277	{nl}Let the Divine Tree take your spirit then, no one will ever even know you're dead.
QUEST_20160811_004278	Thank you.{nl}I'll stay and watch over the brothers.
QUEST_20160811_004279	I would have left already if this wasn't my hometown.{nl}Where on earth were all the Vubbes hiding before they crawled out?

QUEST_20160925_004309	We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20160925_004310	There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.{nl}
QUEST_20160925_004311	They say there are many holy relics hidden in the Tenet Church. {nl}Some of them are said to transport people to a place where no one can go... {nl}Amazing, isn't it?

QUEST_20161005_004406	There I was, thinking that I would be able to relax in my room sipping tea after becoming Master.{nl}That was so naive of me...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004407	It's an annoyance, but the Kannushi did ask me to look into matters, and I can't really leave the Divine Spirits trembling in terror either.{nl}So that's why I am going around putting barriers up, finding Divine Spirits and settling matters.

QUEST_20161005_004423	Any of the antique items from the Royal Family could have Divine Spirits residing in them.{nl}They have awakened by recieving spiritual energy from the Divine Tree for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004424	However, that spiritual energy was cut after Medzio Diena...{nl}They were about to... I believe the word they use here is 'explode'?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004425	Hitomiko couldn't let the precarious situation be left unattended...{nl}Especially since Princess Kaonilla could be put in danger, as she is always surrounded by the antiques of the Royal Family.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004426	That's why she came here, even though she knew she might not be welcomed.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004427	Why can't the Priests feel the Divine Spirits?{nl}Hmm... think of it as the inability to see things at a distance while using a magnifying glass.{nl}Though, I'm not quite sure myself.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004428	Hitomiko managed to gain Princess Kaonilla's permission to prepare the ritual.{nl}She needed to know how the Divine Spirits looked after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004429	I think that the ritual itself was nothing new to Hitomiko.{nl}However, it must have been something surreal to the royalty and priests watching her.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004430	You know, the way she would sway the Gohei and sprinkle something.{nl}Seeing blue energies emerge from certain items to go into Hitomiko's red pouch was a sight to behold.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004431	Finally, the red pouch was placed on the black table with the golden silks that Hitomiko had crafted...{nl}The pouch was then burned by Hitomiko, in front of numerous onlookers.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004432	I bet that was a sight to write down in any history books published after Medzio Diena.{nl}That's how Hitomiko was able to deal with the Divine Spirits near Princess Kaonilla.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004433	That wasn't all though.{nl}The Princess lost consciousness right after the ritual.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004434	The impressive performance hadn't ended though.{nl}Hitomiko remained calm as if she had expected this when nobody else had, and started moving towards the Princess.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004435	Hitomiko approached the throne where Kaonilla was and took a close look.{nl}Then she slowly turned around to all that were watching and said the following.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004436	There had been an evil Divine Spirit that had been possessing Princess Kaonilla...{nl}The evil Divine Spirit had gone to hide in the depths of the Princess' consciousness.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004437	I think she was trying to express the situation in terms that the people of the Kingdom could understand.{nl}Anyways, the room became silent before erupting in outrage.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004438	It was to be expected of course.{nl}It could've be interpreted as an attack on the Princess under the guise of performing a ritual to appease the Divine Spirits.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004439	However, Hitomiko calmed the people in the room and started talking to the priests.{nl}She said that she required their help as well in order to rid the Princess of the Divine Spirit...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004440	Hitomiko calmly told the priests what they needed to do.{nl}They took places near the throne where the Princess was sitting.{nl}After that... just imagine.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004441	All of the priests gathered under the guidance of Hitomiko...{nl}Using their powers on one person!{nl}I don't think that any evil presence could withstand such a situation.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004442	The Princess was able to regain consciousness.{nl}Even if she was a bit worn out.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004443	Hitomiko's work was recognized and she was given similar prestiege as the priests.{nl}In this Kingdom at least.
QUEST_20161005_004444	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? {nl}No. At least pay me for it or something...

QUEST_20161005_004488	The Fortress of the Land which was created by Ruklys in order to safeguard Goddess Laima's Revelation from the demons raised King Kadumel's suspicions and the civil war that resulted from that caused great damage to the Kingdom and the death of Ruklys.{nl}We would like to bring to light the fact that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess and that King Kadumel was also influenced by Eminent.
QUEST_20161005_004489	We announce that those who died as prisoners here as traitors were the victims of misunderstandings.{nl}We argue that we should not mistakenly judge their actions when their only fault was to follow the lead of the devout Ruklys.
QUEST_20161005_004490	The reason Ruklys was unable to tell the King about the Commandments of the Goddess was because the King was Kadumel.{nl}Even King Oluche who had been making wrong decisions remembered to ask the will of the Goddess and decided to step down and raise King Enael the Kind to the throne.{nl}All that read this monument should do well to remember that no good comes from infighting within the Kingdom and to view that as a great deed is even more foolish.
QUEST_20161005_004491	Pouch
QUEST_20161005_004492	You can see a pouch.{nl}You are curious to what is inside.
QUEST_20161005_004493	Rewritten Monument
QUEST_20161005_004494	Priest Lintas and his colleagues, who are upholding the will of Maven the Wise, rewrite the contents of the Monument.
QUEST_20161005_004495	{nl}We finally started to right the wrong on the Year 1096 of our Kingdom.{nl}We have corrected it to mention the wrongdoings of the Royal Family and shortcomings of heroes.
QUEST_20161005_004496	{nl}We swear by the name of the Goddess that all that is written here is the truth.{nl}May we suffer for eternity should that not be the case.
QUEST_20161005_004497	Monument
QUEST_20161005_004498	I, Kadumel, who resides over my people with the blessing of the Goddess raise this monument on the Year 464 of our Kingdom.
QUEST_20161005_004499	{nl}This is to mark the victory over the rebellion that was put down one year prior.
QUEST_20161005_004500	{nl}It also holds great meaning as this is where the remnants of the rebellion are to remain for their lives.
QUEST_20161005_004501	Priest Lintas and his colleagues rewrite the contents of the monument.
QUEST_20161005_004502	{nl}The Fortress of the Land was created in order to safeguard the Revelation of Goddess Laima from the demons.{nl}However, that raised the suspicions of King Kadumel.
QUEST_20161005_004503	{nl}The civil war that resulted from that small suspicion resulted in the death of Ruklys.{nl}We wish to prove that Ruklys had no other intentions than devout faith in the Goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004504	{nl}We would also like to mention that King Kadumel was also influenced by the evil tongue of Eminent.
QUEST_20161005_004505	{nl}Those that lay here have died as prisoners and traitors.{nl}However, we announce that they were the victims of misunderstandings.
QUEST_20161005_004506	{nl}They who are now resting in peace had no fault but that of following Ruklys...{nl}We argue that we must now properly judge their actions under a new light.
QUEST_20161005_004507	{nl}The misunderstandings against Ruklys could only worsen as Kadumel was king.
QUEST_20161005_004508	{nl}Even if King Oluche made many wrong decisions, he listened to the Goddess.{nl}As a result of the consultation, King Enael was able to rise to the throne.
QUEST_20161005_004509	{nl}All that read this must learn from the examples mentioned.{nl}There must not be another civil war and people must not beleive that such conflicts are proud deeds.
QUEST_20161005_004510	Priest Lintas suddenly seems to be acting a bit strange...
QUEST_20161005_004511	It seems as if Goddess Vakarine is at the Demon Prison.{nl}Goddess Gabija is at the Mage Tower, Goddess Saule at Septyni Glen...
QUEST_20161005_004512	{nl}Goddess Lada seems to be at Seir Rainforest.
QUEST_20161005_004513	{nl}They all seem to be in areas where demons often appear.
QUEST_20161005_004514	{nl}Uskis Arable Land is famous for it's bees.{nl}I've heard that Revelators are lured there though.
QUEST_20161005_004515	Goddess Austeja is said to be in Vernike Island, but I've never heard of that place before.
QUEST_20161005_004516	Goddess Jurate is on her boat and palace, the Kivotos.
QUEST_20161005_004517	Goddess Dalia is said to be at Tevhrin Stalactite Caves.{nl}Humans are forbidden from entering that place.
QUEST_20161005_004518	{nl}What type of place do you think the Fantasy Library is?{nl}I suppose there will be a lot of books but what else?
QUEST_20161005_004519	The secret location within the Great Woodlands?{nl}There are more places where I don't know about even if I did hear them from Vaivora's Koru.
QUEST_20161005_004520	Goddess Laima captured by Giltine... Why would she be keeping Goddess Laima?
QUEST_20161005_004521	Unlike the others, Goddess Ausrine is somewhere mysterious where Koru can't talk about.
QUEST_20161005_004522	We've learned about the whereabouts of the Goddesses, but most of the locations are unfamiliar.
QUEST_20161005_004523	Sage Baseline
QUEST_20161005_004524	The underlying power of the Sage is magic.{nl}However, in order for that magic to actually be applied, a Sage requires two more things.{nl}One is the ability to focus magic on one location, and the other is a baseline on which to focus the energy.
QUEST_20161005_004525	If any wizard has enough magic to control space, the tenacity and concentration to focus that magic, all he would require is this baseline.
QUEST_20161005_004526	Sages can't usually use specific objects or geometry to focus magic as they cannot balance the otherworldly space that the Sages usually borrow or connect to.
QUEST_20161005_004527	This is like tying a rope to a twig before casting it into the abyss.{nl}Therefore, any baseline a Sage uses must always maintain a certain capacity. This means that there are sever limitations on what can be used.
QUEST_20161005_004528	A highly trained Sage might be able to use the mountains or the sea, but those will be much to large for most Sages to utilize.
QUEST_20161005_004529	 In other words, they are more than usable, but the Sages do not have the capacity to fully realize their properties.{nl}As such, suprisingly, most Sages are recommended to use the stars.
QUEST_20161005_004530	There are problems when using the stars as well.{nl}There are issues when connecting the wizards to stars far away and also to stars that can't be seen.
QUEST_20161005_004531	In practicality however, Sages can easily utilize stars even if they aren't skilled if they select to rely on the power of the Goddess that controls that star.
QUEST_20161005_004532	As can be seen by this fact, Sages also rely on the Blessing of the Goddesses in order to use magic just like Pyromancers.
QUEST_20161005_004533	The Goddess' Abode of Mount Monderor Volume I
QUEST_20161005_004534	The Goddess' Abode disappeared during the rule of King Jeromel the 2nd.{nl}More than 300 years after the foundation of the Kingdom, there are still many Goddesses and enemies that we don't even know about. As such, they would not have had any clues to which Goddess erased her traces at that time.
QUEST_20161005_004535	What is surprising is that despite the Kingdom's borders growing, the only Abode we know about and can approach above ground is the one at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004536	Apart from that one, there is no history of a Goddess selecting a place for her abode that is accessible by humans.
QUEST_20161005_004537	It has been debated amongst many priests and scholars about whether the place at Mount Monderor was actually used by a Goddess.{nl}The decision was made by those that know best about the Goddesses, so I should be irrefutable.
QUEST_20161005_004538	Of course, the easiest way to reach the truth is for priests to ask their Goddess about their sister that lived at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004539	However, as you might well be aware, the majority of prayers are focused on the well being of humanity and knowledge, not idle curiosity.
QUEST_20161005_004540	I consider it to be similar to why asking the Goddesses about our neighbor's private life is futile since it will never be answered.
QUEST_20161005_004541	Book of the Void
QUEST_20161005_004542	The book you are looking at is a literal wealth of information.{nl}However, there is not much information you will be able to gain from it other than the fact that you cannot learn from this book by reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004543	To be more precise, this book is a medium in which knowledge is stored in an otherworldly place and transfered to the Sage Master. As such, only the Sage Masters will ever be able to learn the knowledge being provided by this book.
QUEST_20161005_004544	If the person reading this book is currently walking the path of a wizard, we hope that you will return it to it's rightful owner.{nl}This book exists for only a certain moment and returns to a normal book after the next Sage Master learns from it.
QUEST_20161005_004545	Before or after that particular moment, this book may exist, but it will not have any particular meaning.
QUEST_20161005_004546	 New Inquisitor's Creed and Decree
QUEST_20161005_004547	We Inquisitors have prided ourselves to not have ever been lax in our duties even when the Goddess' were announcing their presence to you on a daily basis.
QUEST_20161005_004548	The duty of the Inquisitors has always been a heavy one as we cannot forgive those that imply that they are one with the Goddesses and have reached their authority.
QUEST_20161005_004549	Historically, the role of the Inquisitors have been about judging and settling petty disputes that arise between people due to the differences in how they view the Goddess' Blessing and not about the interactions between Goddess and human.
QUEST_20161005_004550	However, the horrid Medzio Diena occurred while I was Master and the Goddesses have disappeared making our responsibility even more important.{nl}The duty of recording and auditing the teachings of the Goddesses has become even more important after the confusion and destruction of Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004551	We have come to a state in which we now must make decisions ourselves when we had not needed to do so when the Goddesses were interacting with us.
QUEST_20161005_004552	I, the Inquisitor Master, am more overwhelmed than enthusiastic about this sudden increase in authority and reach.{nl}Even so, I shall gladly embrace these newly bestowed responsibilities and order all other Inquisitors to do the same.
QUEST_20161005_004553	This is the difference between our responsibilities and those of other priests in this era without the Goddesses post Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004554	We must prevent any discord between those of the cloth whether it be internal or external and this is the only way we will be able to stand in front of the Goddesses and humbly offer our achievements.{nl}Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}Inquisitor Master - Thomas Iquinostasys
QUEST_20161005_004555	Jane, who was the apprentice of Agailla Flurry, was unable to use magic.{nl}That's why she started research on how people like herself could use magic as well.
QUEST_20161005_004556	{nl}Wizards that followed in her footsteps invented Enchant Magic.{nl}It's a new branch of magic where wizards use their powers to give or extract magic from objects.
QUEST_20161005_004557	Allowing people that are unable to use magic to use magic is still a very difficult taks.{nl}That doesn't mean that we are going to give up on it.
QUEST_20161005_004558	{nl}We Enchanters are still tirelessly looking for better ways to do so through our research.
QUEST_20161005_004559	Every night, I dream of running away from a rampaging tree.{nl}I'm just watching as my husband runs to save other people.
QUEST_20161005_004560	{nl}Every time I try to stop him, I wake up.{nl}I wish I could at least stop him from going in my dreams...
QUEST_20161005_004561	I'm just thankful that Liel grew up to be such a bright and cheerful person.
QUEST_20161005_004562	You have told Curtis about the news.
QUEST_20161005_004563	What's going on? Let's finish what we've been asked first.
QUEST_20161005_004564	Beyond Pilgrim's Way is the Great Cathedral, which was built by Maven. {nl}Ruklys, Lydia Schaffen, and Agailla Flurry were all his disciples.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004565	The Great Cathedral was significantly damaged on Medzio Diena, so I wonder if people {nl}still go there. Back then, a great number of people would go there to do various rituals.
QUEST_20161005_004566	The base forms of all things are water, earth, wind, and fire, {nl}and these are controlled by the goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004567	Goddess.{nl}As the commander that leads the knights, I hope I can protect Klaipeda myself.
QUEST_20161005_004568	Highlander Master {nl}[Douglas Black] {nl}An experienced general from the noble class who was in charge of the Royal Guards. {nl}As the leader of Highlanders, he worked up front, saving the world from chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004569	Written by Lucid Winterspoon on Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}I have labored long as the Chronomancer Master, but my mission has been even more complicated after Medzio Diena, 4 years ago.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004570	At first, I thought of the changes in Nheto Forest as a side effect of Medzio Diena just like the other regions.{nl}However, I have always been alert as to the possibility of using Chronomancy illegally and started searching since I felt some irregularities.{nl}I found surprising results as a result of my research, even when I was expecting some time shifts.{nl}I found that there had been considerable damage done to the time frame as well as vegetation as a result of Medzio Diena.{nl}I am worried that there may be those trying to take advantage of these issues, especially the demons.
QUEST_20161005_004571	However, finding the irregularities in Nheto Forest will become my short term mission.{nl}All I can do is to focus on my work about finding the issues and looking for a solution even if it may be too late to stop the side effects plaguing the region.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004572	Recent findings by the Vaivora have been alarming historians.{nl}There had always been a sort of unspoken consensus on the fact that Ruklys was innocent, unlike what is believed by the masses, by those who knew all the facts about the incident.{nl}However, we can see from the documents that this can now be confirmed.
QUEST_20161005_004573	{nl}The documents contain the following contents.{nl}The Fortress of the Land which was built by Ruklys had been authorized through official routes and the seal of King Kadumel had been found on the orders to utilize soldiers and materials for it's construction.{nl}The Vaivora, mages and historians have verified the seal and all the documents to be real. This means the theory that Premier Eminent had played the two main characters against each other has been proven to be true.
QUEST_20161005_004574	{nl}As the truth has been revealed, we feel that it is only right that the heroes are recognized once more and that the misconceptions spread among the masses should be altered.{nl}Even if you take into account that the aftermath of Medzio Diena is still being felt.{nl}Written by Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn on Year 1096 of our Kingdom.

QUEST_20161005_004585	This will require attention to detail even if it is quite simple.{nl}First of all, we must find a book.{nl}This is, of course, in order for as to meet a very special person that is looking for it.

QUEST_20161005_004688	Now let's try to make sense of this with the words written on the stone slate.{nl}It seems as if the King is signified by the statue in the center.

QUEST_20161005_004692	I was in the middle of activating this switch...{nl}Do you think I should move to another pillar?
QUEST_20161005_004693	It simply says that you must prove you are of royal blood to the guardian.

QUEST_20161005_004721	{nl}He said that he didn't harm either the bodies or souls of the humans.{nl}Therefore, I shouldn't be able to interfere.
QUEST_20161005_004722	{nl}Neither a goddess or a demon is allowed to interfere with humans as long as they don't harm them...{nl}That was our deal.
QUEST_20161005_004723	The demons captured me and put the curse on me with Giltine's powers.{nl}I started destroying the forests after being consumed by the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004724	{nl}Only the Demon Goddess is able to control the power of chaos.{nl}My sisters made another agreement with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004725	{nl}We agreed to give up on the petrified city...{nl}In return for myself being sealed here by Gesti, Kartas and Baiga.
QUEST_20161005_004726	{nl}After sealing me here, they gave control of this cave to my sisters.{nl}The Kupoles have been guarding it ever since then.
QUEST_20161005_004727	It is unlikely that they would have hidden Dalia somewhere this obvious.
QUEST_20161005_004728	This seems to be a portal being used by the demons.
QUEST_20161005_004729	I'll infuse the divine energy from the Zolem Core after purifying it...{nl}Medena, please give me strength.
QUEST_20161005_004730	You demons!{nl}These are the demons that kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}We will be able to pinpoint her location if we read their minds.

QUEST_20161005_004732	{nl}Serija said that it is dangerous but...{nl}You can save me if I am consumed by darkness.{nl}We'll have to do our best before giving up.
QUEST_20161005_004733	He will soon arrive. Do not let the Kupole or Revelator enter District 5 before he arrives.
QUEST_20161005_004734	This world will be consumed by chaos when he arrives and frees the insane goddess.

QUEST_20161005_004736	Dalia does not seem to be here.
QUEST_20161005_004737	A stronger force is blocking you. It is not possible to go further.

QUEST_20161005_004751	How could this be!{nl}Has... has the curse been removed?{nl}This can't be...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004752	Gesti.{nl}You shall kneel in front of the power of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004753	I... Do you think that I'll simply kneel before you?!
QUEST_20161005_004754	Savior... I shall focus all of my power into the Divine Orb.{nl}Please defend me from Gesti while I do so.
QUEST_20161005_004755	The Revelator was no match for me even though it wasn't for lack of trying...
QUEST_20161005_004756	{nl}Dalia, it seems that you've merely regained temporary consciousness.{nl}I will continue to bathe you in the Giltine's energy until you succumb!
QUEST_20161005_004757	{nl}I won't stop until you have lost all sense of self and are entirely consumed!

QUEST_20161005_004760	Kupoles...{nl}Go back to your locations.

QUEST_20161005_004762	Thank you Medena.{nl}You have gone through much in order to protect me thus far.
QUEST_20161005_004763	{nl}You even managed to call a Savior...{nl}Laima must have forseen all of this.
QUEST_20161005_004764	Savior, I thank you.{nl}I was able to undo some of my previous wrongdoings thanks to your efforts in purifying the chaos that surrounded me.
QUEST_20161005_004765	{nl}However, this is not the end of the adventure.{nl}You are destined for much greater deeds than this in the future...
QUEST_20161005_004766	{nl}So please, leave Gesti to me.
QUEST_20161005_004767	Just listen to you talking nonsense.

QUEST_20161005_004769	{nl}You said that you would gladly give your life...
QUEST_20161005_004770	{nl}All preparations are complete.{nl}You shall die with me here.
QUEST_20161005_004771	It seems as if the demons are growing even more violent.
QUEST_20161005_004772	I hope the Goddess is still safe...{nl}I really do...
QUEST_20161005_004773	I can't believe that the Kupoles have become so weakened...
QUEST_20161005_004774	Even Serija has been captured by the demons...
QUEST_20161005_004775	I do at least feel a bit better now that I have seen her.
QUEST_20161005_004776	We have finally arrived at the place where Goddess Dalia is.{nl}I hope she is okay...
QUEST_20161005_004777	Even the Kupoles have trouble meeting Dalia without protection magic.
QUEST_20161005_004778	The demons have kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}I saw them with my own two eyes!{nl}There were three of them!
QUEST_20161005_004779	Serija... She is wounded...{nl}We need to find her!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004780	Goddess Dalia seems to have regained consciousness... I haven't seen her like this for a long time...
QUEST_20161005_004781	It sounds like the screams of Serija!{nl}Something must have happened!
QUEST_20161005_004782	Please tell me as soon as you are prepared.
QUEST_20161005_004783	Leave the lower levels to the Tala Tribe.
QUEST_20161005_004784	Now, the day of total destruction will come upon us.
QUEST_20161005_004785	We demons will free the goddess from her seal.
QUEST_20161005_004786	We shall take the goddess.

QUEST_20161005_004790	{nl}Please lead the Kupoles as far away from the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave as you can...{nl}There is not much time left.{nl}I will lose consciousness soon...

QUEST_20161005_004792	{nl}Whomever it may be, one of the demon lords are coming towards Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}I will soon be consumed by the power of chaos at this rate.
QUEST_20161005_004793	{nl}Then they will free me from the seal.{nl}What happens next will be... death and destruction...
QUEST_20161005_004794	{nl}So please... Go as far away as possible.{nl}Far enough away so that I will not be able to find you...
QUEST_20161005_004795	Ah... That...
QUEST_20161005_004796	{nl}Saule... an divine orb with Saule's powers...{nl}Perhaps that will be good enough...
QUEST_20161005_004797	{nl}If I can use my powers along with the divine orb with Saule's powers, I will be able to face the Demon Kings.{nl}However, I will have to maintain consciousness while resisting the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004798	{nl}The curse is solidifying it's grasp on me once more.{nl}The many evil statues that the demons installed here and there while I was kidnapped...
QUEST_20161005_004799	{nl}They are adding even more energy to the power of the curse.{nl}I will prepare for the battle with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004800	{nl}So please destroy the statues for me.{nl}This will allow me to be able to resist the power of chaos until I fight the Demon Kings...
QUEST_20161005_004801	The monsters here will have seen the demons hide the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004802	I thought so... The Tala Tribe knew about the whereabouts of the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004803	The Demon Kings... Do you think we'll have the power to face them?
QUEST_20161005_004804	Divine power this strong...{nl}It isn't any weaker than the energy of the Demon Kings I felt earlier!
QUEST_20161005_004805	There is no time to lose.{nl}The magical core should be enough to open the road.{nl}Let's go!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004806	Goddess Dalia... Do you hear me?
QUEST_20161005_004807	Do you think this will end with my death?{nl}That is pathetic.
QUEST_20161005_004808	{nl}Kartas will tear your souls apart.{nl}You will regret not dying at my hands!
QUEST_20161005_004809	It's lucky that we at least found the demon's portal now.
QUEST_20161005_004810	The road has opened!{nl}Let's go to District 2 of Tevhrin Stalactite Cave!
QUEST_20161005_004811	Revelator...{nl}You and I have such a long and tenuous relationship!

QUEST_20161005_004818	You cannot seem to find Lina.{nl}It seems as if she has gone to install supplements elsewhere.
QUEST_20161005_004819	You should try organizing what you have heard.
QUEST_20161005_004820	What are your thoughts on the leaves you've seen?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004821	You think that it was balanced due to the struggle between the two of us?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004822	I had never thought about that...
QUEST_20161005_004823	Balance...{nl}That makes sense.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004824	Although I did ruin Lina's work, I never stopped her from doing anything.{nl}I always interrupted her work after she started it.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004825	Maybe it was just the right timing to stop anything from dying?
QUEST_20161005_004826	I thought that we were causing trouble for the refugees.{nl}Whatever the case, we fought in front of the humans even when we should have been adhering to the will of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004827	{nl}However, I thought that protecting the forest was the way to protect the refugees here.
QUEST_20161005_004828	There doesn't seem to be anything special about the leaves even if their colors are quite vibrant.
QUEST_20161005_004829	You cannot see the growth rings outside of the stump.
QUEST_20161005_004830	You have already checked this stump.
QUEST_20161005_004831	What happened to the forest...{nl}I'm glad that the vegetation isn't overgrowing anymore but...
QUEST_20161005_004832	I am worried since there are less herbs for us to use...{nl}There are herbs that can only be gathered during autum, but each herb has it's own use.
QUEST_20161005_004833	Of course, it's beneficial in the short term since we have more wood to fell.{nl}However, there will be no more trees at this rate.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004834	Trees don't grow during autum you see.
QUEST_20161005_004835	I wonder when I'll be able to get the report I requested...{nl}I have to report to the Chronomancer Master after reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004836	Thank you so much for helping.{nl}I was able to finish the experiments much faster thanks to your help.{nl}

QUEST_20161005_004880	This is from before there was a large statue in Fedimian.{nl}Of course, there was a small statue even then.
QUEST_20161005_004881	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20161005_004882	 Modestas admitted defeat and said he'd pay him pay back. As he was leaving the place with wagon in tow, the old alchemist broke into a strange smile that caught Modestas' attention.
QUEST_20161005_004883	 Unbelievably, the piece of lead turned into gold in front of Modestas after a flash of suspicious light. 
QUEST_20161005_004884	 Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal.
QUEST_20161005_004885	[Since you seem to be worrying about how to move this boulder, what about this?{nl}I usually don't change the deal, but I'll make a special offer to add some fun.{nl}How about seeing if I can move this boulder on to your cart?{nl}You'll be able to receive help moving the boulder even if you lose the bet.]{nl}Modestas nodded in agreement since the deal seemed fair.{nl}However, the old woman started talking as soon as she saw him nod.
QUEST_20161005_004886	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20161005_004887	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004888	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004889	The officer offered him help as soon as he heard that Modestas would be moving the boulder to Klaipeda.{nl}The officer and his men secured the boulder with strong ropes to prevent it from falling off and said that he would accompany him to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas thanked the soldiers and accepted their offer. 
QUEST_20161005_004890	Modestas met the alchemist on the way to Klaipeda.{nl}He gave the gold bar since a promise was a promise.{nl}The alchemist started talking to Modestas as he seemed surprised by the fact that Modestas gave the gold bar without any resistance.
QUEST_20161005_004891	Everyone listened to them talking since they where curious about the bet.{nl}That's how they started talking about how they got involved with Modestas. The alchemist became sorry for fooling Modestas.
QUEST_20161005_004892	That's why he told Modestas that he would make arrangements to help him when he got to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas was able to take the boulder to the center of Klaipeda and set the boulder down in the Central Plaza.
QUEST_20161005_004893	Just as the boulder was set down by the soldiers, the alchemist came with someone.{nl}The person that came with the alchemist was the famous sculpture and Dievdirbys Tesla.{nl}The alchemest started talking.
QUEST_20161005_004894	[How about sculpting a Goddess Statue with this boulder in the center of Klaipeda. I think that everyone in Klaipeda will recognize it's value if the boulder becomes a Goddess Statue. If so, I think that the conditions between yourself and the old woman will be met.]{nl}Everyone there agreed that this would be a good idea.
QUEST_20161005_004895	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004896	The person to solve this problem was none other than Modestas.{nl}He thought that even if he didn't set out to do so, he should try to organize things as he was raising a Goddess Statue in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}He realized that the Goddess had appeared in front of him in the form of an old woman and tried to let the other people know of this fact.{nl}The people decided to believe Modestas and the Goddess Statue was allowed to be made.
QUEST_20161005_004897	When the Goddess Statue was finally complete, the people of Klaipeda were curious to see which Goddess would stand in the center of their beloved city.{nl}However, they were alarmed to see that they could not recognize who the Goddess was. 
QUEST_20161005_004898	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004899	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004900	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004901	However, Modestas didn't lose a bet even under the most dire circumstances. Therefore, many years passed without anyone learning the truth about the Goddess Statue.{nl}Modestas passed away undefeated, but never betting again after that incident.
QUEST_20161005_004902	People were finally able to learn that the Goddess Statue in Klaipeda was meant to be Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Goddess Ausrine took betting away from a man's life, but she also created a interesting mystery and a Goddess Statue in the middle of Klaipeda.

The instruction is as follows.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 {nl} 0 {nl}Following the instruction allows the user to transmute one type of root into another by placing it in the order. However, it does not apply to all types of roots.{/}
QUEST_20161005_004906	 Secondly, the transmutation of one type of shell into another. The process is slightly more complicated than the previous method. There are some that work well the other not so much.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} Placing it in that order, it can transmute one type of shell into another.{/}
QUEST_20161005_004907	 The last procedure to be included in this part 1 is how to transmute one type of wing to another. The possibilities are wider than the previous two. Even I, the author of this book, cannot fully categorize them all. The procedure is like the following.{nl}{nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl} x | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004908	 As a final word, I do believe that there will be some who are having difficulties understanding this text. It bears repeating. Place one type of item in the place marked

QUEST_20161214_005017	We are beings born of the same roots.{nl}Yet, we have carried out our dispute for too long; this treaty is, sadly, the sole occasion in which we have reached an agreement.{nl}

QUEST_20161214_005019	We choose this, one of the paths where we first let humankind out from under the ground, as the venue of our pact.{nl}As we diverged most widely in our opinions on humanity, we find this to be an appropriate location.
QUEST_20161214_005020	With the enactment of this treaty, we aim for a cessation of our millennia-long dispute.{nl}Furthermore, we make known our wish for this to become the start of eternal peace. 
QUEST_20161214_005021	{nl}First, we shall refer to Giltine, as well as all her allies and subordinates as Giltine's faction.{nl}Ausrine, along with her goddess and Kupole following, shall be referred to as Ausrine's faction.{nl}

QUEST_20161214_005026	Five. Should any clause of this agreement be violated, the perpetrators shall be consumed by the Divine Tree, regardless of their position,{nl}as that is the sole means for each faction to permanently destroy the other.
QUEST_20161214_005027	Six. Excluding cases pertaining to article Five, neither faction shall, under any circumstances, attempt to destroy the other through the Divine Tree.
QUEST_20161214_005028	Prophecy Tome

QUEST_20161214_005030	First you will need to disable the magic that's guarding the treaty seal.{nl}Find the light of the seal and make all the other lights stand out to dispel the magic.

QUEST_20161214_005032	To obtain the demon treaty, you need an evil offering.{nl}Of course, I don't expect you to be carrying around any evil objects.{nl}It may not be the best option, but I believe you can get some evil energy from monster blood.{nl}First, hunt the monsters to collect their blood.

QUEST_20161214_005036	To obtain a token of the goddess treaty, you need the Goddess' Stone of Faith.{nl}I left the stone in Sviesos Way.{nl}However, according to my prophecy, the altar where I left it was destroyed during Medzio Diena.{nl}But it should still be in Sviesos Way.

QUEST_20161214_005039	If you have the key, now you need to find the slate with the treaty.{nl}Go to the Yudejan Altar and find the box that opens with the key; you'll find the treaty slate inside.

QUEST_20161214_005049	No idea how it started.{nl}Everyone's all hush-hush, no one wants to talk to an outsider like me, I guess.
QUEST_20161214_005050	{nl}The way they're whispering though, I couldn't help but hear it even if I didn't want to.{nl}They're saying someone appeared and saved Orsha from some sort of danger.
QUEST_20161214_005051	{nl}I wonder if it was something like Medzio Diena?

QUEST_20161214_005056	{nl}But you're welcome to speak to her about any problem if you wish.
QUEST_20161214_005057	Heard ya took care of Ebonypawn, huh?{nl}You did what I should've done myself... Guess I should thank you.
QUEST_20161214_005058	{nl}Then again, it's a bit of a letdown.{nl}Not trying to dismiss what you did, don't get me wrong.

QUEST_20161214_005071	After touching the water... some stamina was released!
QUEST_20161214_005072	It's probably wiser not to touch this.

QUEST_20170313_005558	{nl}Now... I'm guessing Andale Village is also deserted...{nl}From what I heard after coming here, this was all a curse by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_20170313_005559	That new family that moved in...{nl}I actually never saw them.

QUEST_20170313_005565	{nl}Our neighbor, Mr. Raman, was always praising my brother.{nl}He must be gone now, too... Taken by those demons...

QUEST_20170313_005570	Guess there isn't much to find other than this bowl.
QUEST_20170313_005571	I bet this is nothing.
QUEST_20170313_005572	This looks like it will be dangerous to tamper with.
QUEST_20170313_005573	Nothing interesting to see here.
QUEST_20170313_005574	Smokey Spot
QUEST_20170313_005575	Should I throw away the water from before here?

QUEST_20170313_005578	{nl}Now that I think about it...
QUEST_20170313_005579	{nl}You're back.{nl}Is there anything else you want to know?
QUEST_20170313_005580	A long time ago, goddesses and demons made an agreement that they would not interfere with each other.{nl}One of the conditions of this pact was that demons were not allowed to murder humans.
QUEST_20170313_005581	{nl}Then, 600 years ago, Gesti placed a curse in the Roxona region.{nl}She did so under the pretext that it was in response to Ruklys' rebellion.
QUEST_20170313_005582	{nl}Goddess Dalia stood forward to help those in Roxona.{nl}The petrified city with the forgotten name...
QUEST_20170313_005583	{nl}Then, the demons appeared and brought up the agreement.{nl}They claimed that the victims had not been murdered, merely petrified, and attacked Goddess Dalia.{nl}That is how she became trapped in the curse of the demon goddess.
QUEST_20170313_005584	{nl}The curse imparted in Goddess Dalia clashed with her own divine force, forming something immensely more powerful.{nl}This left Dalia in the state you know Her as...
QUEST_20170313_005585	{nl}That is why the entire area was burned to the ground...{nl}There was nothing that could bring the goddess back to her own conscience...
QUEST_20170313_005586	{nl}So the three Demon Kings imprisoned Dalia, and the Kupoles were left to watch over Her.{nl}No other goddesses dared to interfere with the petrified city after that.
QUEST_20170313_005587	{nl}Some might criticize the goddesses for their lack of action when they hear about this.{nl}But I believe it was a reasonable choice to make at the time.
QUEST_20170313_005588	Oh no...{nl}But then, who would frame someone like that?
QUEST_20170313_005589	{nl}And why...?
QUEST_20170313_005590	The secret could have been hidden in Ruklys' memorial.{nl}The truth about the real hero who took the blame at the time, that is...
QUEST_20170313_005591	Why would Premier Eminent think of doing something like that?{nl}I ought to investigate further.
QUEST_20170313_005592	It won't be easy now that the contents of the memorial are gone.{nl}I wonder if there isn't a way to recover them...
QUEST_20170313_005593	Glad to see you again.{nl}What's the occasion?
QUEST_20170313_005594	So Ruklys was not a traitor?{nl}That means that rubbed copy was still useful...
QUEST_20170313_005595	I can get some more charcoal and make a new copy of Lydia Schaffen's tombstone.{nl}Should be able to read it then, right?
QUEST_20170313_005596	{nl}We might even get some insight into her history, don't you think?
QUEST_20170313_005597	{nl}It's still a relief, you know?{nl}With the way the world is nowadays, some people never get to clean their own name.
QUEST_20170313_005598	{nl}At least some can still get their honor back.

QUEST_20170313_005602	I can't see much from where I stand, so I spent a lot of time on my own.{nl}I don't know if you humans are like this too, but spending time alone, thinking, makes us realize certain things.
QUEST_20170313_005603	{nl}Where we came from, things like that...
QUEST_20170313_005604	Maybe you realized those things through your journeys.{nl}Us owls, you can say that we're signs of Tesla's immortality.
QUEST_20170313_005605	{nl}Strictly speaking, us owls are merely sculptures.{nl}Perhaps some owls never realize that...
QUEST_20170313_005606	{nl}In any case, it's because we are born that Tesla keeps on living.{nl}
QUEST_20170313_005607	I thought about it for a long time.{nl}Even as I witnessed all the spirits being guided by the owls.
QUEST_20170313_005608	{nl}What am I, where did I come from, and where am I going...?
QUEST_20170313_005609	All those who have crossed my path, travelers, revelators...{nl}All the pilgrims... the girl...
QUEST_20170313_005610	{nl}From the things they said, from what I saw the first time I opened my eyes...{nl}I realized.
QUEST_20170313_005611	{nl}I realized that I'm a sculpture...
QUEST_20170313_005612	{nl}There are other beings whose task is to guide spirits.{nl}The Kupoles, that is...{nl}But they are closer to goddesses, which us sculptures are not.

QUEST_20170313_005623	A ripped piece of paper. There's something written on it, but it's hard to tell what it is.
QUEST_20170313_005624	The other pieces of the paper are needed to read the full text. Look for them in Genar Field.

QUEST_20170313_005632	How did you get stung? Doesn't it hurt?
QUEST_20170313_005633	The bees are very sensitive right now, so they'll attack more easily.
QUEST_20170313_005634	I dunno... We also tried everything we could think of, but nothing worked.{nl}The followers of goddess Austeja will probably know more about it.
QUEST_20170313_005635	The followers of Goddess Austeja probably know a better way to calm down the bees.
QUEST_20170313_005636	Seems like the forest nearby was also having a bit of a problem with its plants.
QUEST_20170313_005637	I'm not sure, but if there's any related materials I guess I can have a look.{nl}Maybe that can help me find something.
QUEST_20170313_005638	After the last letdown, now it's time for success!

QUEST_20170313_005647	I used to drink strawberry punch him with all the time.{nl}Sometimes he'd do a less-than-stellar job at repairing a weapon or something.
QUEST_20170313_005648	Every time he would say it was the iced punch that made his hands slip.
QUEST_20170313_005649	But I know.{nl}It wasn't the strawberry punch's fault, he just makes a lot of mistakes, that's all.
QUEST_20170313_005650	In my village there was a girl called Ailije. She was a merchant, but she had a great hand for cooking and often made food or sauces for other people. Her strawberry jam was the best. I also learned how to make strawberry jam from her. Any time we had strawberries at the camp, I always made strawberry jam and shared with the other soldiers. 
QUEST_20170313_005651	Strawberries, strawberries! Oh, I can't wait to eat them...{nl}Thank you so much. These are a treat!

QUEST_20170313_005661	I can help you dispell it.
QUEST_20170313_005662	Where were you cursed?{nl}The malice in your curse was too deep to be human-made.
QUEST_20170313_005663	An evil spirit...
QUEST_20170313_005664	I worry the spirit will disturb those who rest in the Mokusul Chamber.

QUEST_20170313_005680	Objects on the Ground
QUEST_20170313_005681	There's something here.{nl}Should I touch it?
QUEST_20170313_005682	The position of Appraiser Master has been vacant since Medzio Diena, which put me in a rather difficult situation.
QUEST_20170313_005683	{nl}I figured I could sell my family heirloom and help those less fortunate, even if only a little.{nl}I heard the Pardoner Master has an interest in old heirlooms, so I went to see him.
QUEST_20170313_005684	{nl}Unfortunately he doesn't want anything that's not certified by the Appraiser Master.{nl}If only someone took over the position...
QUEST_20170313_005685	Maybe you won't believe me, but I'm actually involved in helping the refugees.{nl}With the money I make selling my accessories, that is.
QUEST_20170313_005686	{nl}Recently, however, some merchants have been making forgeries of my products and selling them on the market.{nl}My sales have suffered because I can't compete with their fake accessories.
QUEST_20170313_005687	{nl}That makes it difficult for me to help the refugees.{nl}If only I had a sort of certificate to prove that my products are genuine.
QUEST_20170313_005688	{nl}Unfortunately only an Appraiser Master can do that, and no one has taken the position since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20170313_005689	{nl}There's really nothing I can do about it.
QUEST_20170313_005690	I didn't realize the absence of an Appraiser Master caused so much inconvenience.{nl}I suppose it won't be solved until someone steps up to the position.
QUEST_20170313_005691	{nl}Usually the king would be the one to appoint a new class master, but considering we don't have one anymore... Hmm...
QUEST_20170313_005692	{nl}Although, a royal carte blanche could be useful in this situation.{nl}A sort of document with powers granted by someone in the royal family or a figure of authority.
QUEST_20170313_005693	{nl}I believe an attendant of Princess Gaivile is staying in Klaipeda at the moment, I should try and contact them.
QUEST_20170313_005694	Knight Commander Uska went to speak with the attendant of Princess Gaivile about the position of Appraiser Master.
QUEST_20170313_005695	I've just returned from speaking with Princess Gaivile's attendant.{nl}The princess has agreed to grant us a royal order.
QUEST_20170313_005696	{nl}To make the order valid, we need it signed by at least three people of high authority.{nl}This could be a high-tier commander or a noble person in a position of similar power.
QUEST_20170313_005697	{nl}As a knight commander myself, I'll take the liberty of being the first to sign it.{nl}Now, as for the other two signatures...
QUEST_20170313_005698	{nl}It will be difficult for the princess' attendant to travel, not to mention he will be busy with his duties.{nl}So I told him I would pass the task onto you.{nl}What do you say?
QUEST_20170313_005699	Pricess Gaivile's Attendant
QUEST_20170313_005700	I was just about to tend to my work for Princess Gaivile.
QUEST_20170313_005701	Uska told me you would come.{nl}As you can see, I am too busy with my duties to Princess Gaivile to gather the signatures.
QUEST_20170313_005702	{nl}I hope that is why you came to see me.{nl}On a first impression I can tell Uska was right to trust you.{nl}But enough chatter, I should tell you what it is you will need to do first.
QUEST_20170313_005703	{nl}Visit the southern regions of the kingdom and search for people of nobility or with a certain degree of power.{nl}Then, obtain their signature on the royal order.

QUEST_20170313_005705	Gather the signatures of noble people and figures of authority from the southern regions of the kingdom.
QUEST_20170313_005706	Uska ought to send someone any time soon...{nl}I have work to do...

QUEST_20170313_005708	You need my signature on a royal order?{nl}Very well, let me have a look at it first.
QUEST_20170313_005709	{nl}Hm... It seems you're trying to nominate someone to the position of Appraiser Master.
QUEST_20170313_005710	{nl}Here, I've signed it for you.
QUEST_20170313_005711	So you need me to sign a royal order?{nl}Alright, I'll have a look at it.
QUEST_20170313_005712	{nl}Oh, this is an order from the princess to nominate Sandra to the position of Appraiser Master.{nl}Yes, I can sign it for you.
QUEST_20170313_005713	Royal Order
QUEST_20170313_005714	By the power invested in me as the effective agent of His Majesty, late ruler of our great kingdom, I, Kaonilla, hereby declare the present order, in benefit of the people of our nation, in the wake of the greatest disaster it has witnessed in more than a millennium of history.
QUEST_20170313_005715	In the scope of my duty as member of the royal family to preserve order and peace for all of the kingdom's subjects, the present order serves as a limited yet necessary action in the current state of institutional and legislative instability of our nation.
QUEST_20170313_005716	It is my sincere wish that they who bear this order will not make use of it for personal gain nor act on corrupt intentions upon obtaining it.
QUEST_20170313_005717	1. In the possession of a suitable bearer, the present order shall be considered equivalent to a royal decree of the king.{nl}2. The present order shall not be valid until it has been verified and signed by no less than three generals or commanders of the royal army, or noble persons of similar authority.{nl}3. I, Kaonilla, as agent of the kingdom, consent to full responsibility for the legislative repercussions of the present order.{nl}4. Any unjust orders commanded or performed under the authority of the present document shall remain valid until directly condemned by an agent of the royal family.{nl}5. It is the responsibility of the bearer of the present order to obtain the approval required for its validity as defined in article 2.
QUEST_20170313_005718	To the bearer of the present order I, Princess Gaivile, under the command of Kaonilla, hereby declare that Appraiser Sandra, resident of Fedimian, will be promptly assigned the position of Appraiser Master.
QUEST_20170313_005719	Klaipeda Knight Commander Uska
QUEST_20170313_005720	The royal order smells slightly of chemicals.
QUEST_20170313_005721	The empty space between the contents of the order and the first signature looks far too wide.
QUEST_20170313_005722	The royal order looks a little suspicious.{nl}Someone ought to know about it.
QUEST_20170313_005723	Are you saying the royal order looks strange?{nl}In what way, may I ask?
QUEST_20170313_005724	Very well, let me have a look.
QUEST_20170313_005725	Indeed, the blank space here is rather wide and it does smell of chemicals.{nl}In this day, a royal order from a successor like Princess Kaonilla...
QUEST_20170313_005726	{nl}But didn't you say you obtained this through Princess Gaivile?{nl}Then I believe this order ought to be analyzed one more time before it returns to her.
QUEST_20170313_005727	There must be someone who can have a look at the royal order.
QUEST_20170313_005728	Oh... This is the royal order Uska got to nominate me to Appraiser Master.{nl}But you say it smells like chemicals... and the gap between the lines is too wide?
QUEST_20170313_005729	{nl}That really is strange.{nl}Official royal documents are usually redacted with no spaces in between the lines, you see.{nl}To prevent them from being altered.
QUEST_20170313_005730	{nl}Let me have a better look at it.{nl}May I?
QUEST_20170313_005731	As you mentioned, the document does smell slightly of chemicals.{nl}That fact that you noticed that is quite impressive in itself.
QUEST_20170313_005732	{nl}As for the space between the contents of the order and the signature... It does look like there's something there.{nl}I can't make much of it yet for now, however.
QUEST_20170313_005733	{nl}To get a more accurate analysis I would need a special chemical.{nl}Unfortunately it's very rare... although an experienced alchemist might be able to produce some.{nl}Do you know any alchemists we could ask?
QUEST_20170313_005734	Do you mean a chemical to reveal invisible ink?{nl}I don't really talk about this to anyone but... given our relationship, I think it's okay to let you in on it.
QUEST_20170313_005735	{nl}I can actually make some really easily with a special reagent and some Weynd and Driekple flowers.{nl}I'll give you a recipe for the reagent.{nl}The flowers are a little more difficult to find, however.
QUEST_20170313_005736	{nl}If you can find some Weynd flowers, picking them should be easy.{nl}The problem is finding them. No one knows where they grow.
QUEST_20170313_005737	{nl}Driekple flowers need to be watered at regular times with the right amount of water.
QUEST_20170313_005738	Oh wow, you really did bring all the materials to make the chemical.{nl}I'm very curious to hear how you got the flowers, but first I should finish the chemical.
QUEST_20170313_005739	The special chemical is finished now.{nl}You should be able to see the hidden writings now.
QUEST_20170313_005740	I really want to know what you're going to use it for, but you look worried enough so I won't ask.
QUEST_20170313_005741	Vaidotas is making the special chemical.
QUEST_20170313_005742	Take the special chemical to Appraiser Sandra.

QUEST_20170420_005869	Reset Helper Kupole
QUEST_20170420_005870	We're providing stat, skill and rank reset items every day.
QUEST_20170420_005871	You already received your reset items today.
QUEST_20170420_005872	To take free will away from humans is something even the goddesses condemn.{nl}But what the Monk Master Olfas Grimm has planned, whether right or wrong, is harmful to many people and can even kill them.{nl}That is what saddens me.
QUEST_20170420_005873	The Monk Master wants to train mercenary gladiators in secret and trade them to gain control of the capital's arena. Morally, I find this hard to condone.{nl}But it seems Olfas Grimm himself believes his deeds are justified for contributing to a greater good.
QUEST_20170420_005874	Monks are different from other Cleric faiths in that they pay service to the goddesses not through their relation to Them, but through self-training.{nl}However, by breaking his deal with the Corsair Master and refusing to pay, Grimm has disregarded even the values any good business person should have.{nl}Although I do agree that, as Monk Master, keeping a promise to a pirate would do nothing but harm.
QUEST_20170420_005875	Monks believe it is right to do not what the goddesses want, but what the goddesses need.{nl}For people like Olfas Grimm, their physical training only reinforces this belief, the idea that anything is justifiable if it is for the sake of the goddesses.{nl}It came as a surprise to everyone when, without hesitation, he broke the double contract he had signed with the Schwarzer Reiter and Doppelsoeldner Masters.
QUEST_20170420_005876	Nemoken borrowed a large sum from the Monk Master in order to lure assassin Evoniphon by pretending to hire him.{nl}In the end, she could neither catch Evoniphon not return the money.{nl}This was a chance for the Monk Master to find her weakness.{nl}He may have no plans to take advantage of this weakness yet, but he surely won't forget it after they are even.
QUEST_20170420_005877	It's true that Hayraven, the Corsair Master, has become kinder after Medzio Diena forced him to return to solid ground.{nl}But that does not excuse all the crimes he commited before that.
QUEST_20170420_005878	Hayraven was always most violent when attacking other pirate ships.{nl}Many were the times when he pillaged whole merchant vessels, and to rival pirates he was particularly cruel.{nl}He did not kill those whom he captured; instead he sent them over to the Monk Master, but he never received payment for it. You can see why Hayraven isn't very fond of Olfas Grimm now.
QUEST_20170420_005879	In a way, Hayraven is someone in charge of his own destiny.{nl}In the eyes of the goddesses, he is no more important than the Great Pirate Vladslovas whom he had killed.{nl}Ultimately, he turned fate in his favor out of sheer will.{nl}And perhaps a little help from his cunning nature...
QUEST_20170420_005880	Had Jurate, goddess of the sea, been a little more interested in the lives of humans, the sea would have been peaceful, with or without the royal navy.{nl}When She did come into contact with humans again, Hayraven was already on land after losing his ship.{nl}It was all due to Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20170420_005881	The only reason why the Corsair Master is not preparing to return to the sea now that the royal navy is weakened, is that there aren't as many ships sailing anymore.{nl}It may sound contradictory, but him going back to the sea would be a sign of the Kingdom returning to normal life.
QUEST_20170420_005882	Before Medzio Diena, the Corsair Master came across a few of the Doppelsoeldner Master's soldiers at sea and destroyed their ship.{nl}Guerra, the Doppelsoeldner Master, has hated him since.{nl}Both Masters aren't the type to shy away from one-on-one confrontations, but neither do they tend to get involved in anything that isn't profitable.{nl}It's hard to even say who would win if they were ever to face each other.
QUEST_20170420_005883	After Olfas Grimm broke his contract with the Doppelsoeldner Master and embezzled the money, he's been searching for legal ways to take revenge on the Monk Master.{nl}He would not be satisfied with merely having him killed.
QUEST_20170420_005884	As leaders of mercenary groups, the Doppelsoeldner and Schwarzer Reiter Masters haven't always been on good terms.{nl}But after the contract misadventure with the Monk Master, his grudge became only deeper.
QUEST_20170420_005885	Unlike the Schwarzer Reiter Master, Guerra values his group's reputation, authority, and most of all, profits.{nl}He believes these factors to be crucial when it comes to increasing their combat power and strategic expertise.
QUEST_20170420_005886	Guerra is not, in fact, the Doppelsoeldner Master's birth name.{nl}Many assume that, by adopting a new name, he was either attempting to disguise his noble ancestry due to his activities as a mercenary leader, or the opposite, his low-class origins.{nl}I do know the truth about his heritage, but I mustn't reveal a personal secret.
QUEST_20170420_005887	Warsis, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, originally descends from a family of commoners.{nl}He adopted his surname from subordinates and enemies who, astounded by his competence, gave him the nickname of Creak.
QUEST_20170420_005888	Unlike the Doppelsoeldner Master and his mercenaries, the Schwarzer Reiter Master is more akin to a war aficionado.{nl}He promotes comradeship among his mercenaries, with all profits earned benefiting both him and his subordinates.{nl}An ideal troupe to him is one of talented warriors joined together by deep comradeship and strict military discipline.
QUEST_20170420_005889	Upon learning about what happened to the subordinates he had taken over from the Monk Master, the Schwarzer Reiter Master was as furious as if he had been personally attacked himself.{nl}Since this incident, Warsis Creak despises the Monk Master, but also Hayraven and the Doppelsoeldner Master, due to what he considers a dishonest management of mercenaries.
QUEST_20170420_005890	Warsis Creak, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, is a prime figure in the military field.{nl}He is a man of astounding combat prowess and strategic technique, but also of considerable social and cultural refinement.{nl}The reason he hasn't applied for the royal army is that he believes he would be unable to experiment with and master diverse types of weapons and techniques.
QUEST_20170420_005891	As a leader with fairly liberal views, the Schwarzer Reiter Master will not hesitate to introduce new guns or other weapons to his group of mercenaries.{nl}Because of this, he is considered to be the most decent Master among the four who run mercenary troupes.
QUEST_20170420_005892	Rashua, the Swordsman Master, had dedicated his entire life to military service.{nl}Now, he merely tries to bear with the agony of witnessing the misery that has struck the kingdom.
QUEST_20170420_005893	Maria Leed, the Peltasta Master, believes that taking part in combat should earn anyone proper compensation.{nl}But most of all, to her, going to battle is a question of honor.{nl}It's one of the reasons why she remains so impassive to the Highlander Master's persuasion.
QUEST_20170420_005894	Highlander Master Douglas Black is a courteous, dignified man, as much so as the residence he inherited from the distinguished family of which he descends.
QUEST_20170420_005895	I still feel like I am in debt to Walder Junnot, the Barbarian Master, for never having had the time to really help his family.
QUEST_20170420_005896	I strongly believe we will one day live in a peaceful world where Hoplite Master Aidas Valor and his partner Flyntess??以춏 raise a family.
QUEST_20170420_005897	Kamiya, the Rodelero Master, is an outstanding soldier, but he isn't sure which army he ought to serve.{nl}I try not to interfere and instead respect his decisions.
QUEST_20170420_005898	Memet Culag, the Cataphract Master, forwent marriage to follow his own path.{nl}He may have no descendants to carry his name, but his achievements certainly will.
QUEST_20170420_005899	Justina Legwyn, the Squire Master, is the last descendant of her family. It's an unfortunate destiny, having to carry the responsibility of both those positions...
QUEST_20170420_005900	At her young age, Sorscha Hutton is already set to become the greatest Fencer Master to date.{nl}Anyone who dares to cross her path can only expect to face the cold blade of destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005901	Born to a family of commoners, Uska grew to become a general of the royal army, Knight Commander and Templar Master.{nl}His sword is respected wherever he goes, and he is as responsible as he is talented.
QUEST_20170420_005902	Valeska Himil, Dragoon Master and representative of the Himils, is set to have an important role in the future of her family.{nl}No one knows whether their spear will return to Schaffenstar or not, but  either way it's going to be a historic decision.
QUEST_20170420_005903	Shinobi Master Yura Swanjone works behind the scenes with the royal family, stealthily thwarting any forces that dare threaten the throne.
QUEST_20170420_005904	Phelixia, the Murmillo Master, does not shy away from putting her life on the line.{nl}With anything she does, however, she puts tremendous effort into making sure she is ahead and in charge of her destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005905	Noer Parecius, descendant of a great king! The throne may never belong to him, but his lance will certainly have him remembered as a king of war.
QUEST_20170420_005906	Centurion Master Krajicek is a role model to every member of the royal army.{nl}It's a shame that the current state of the army is hindering him.
QUEST_20170420_005907	I truly respect the Matador Master's outlook on life.{nl}It simply saddens me that her incredible talent and influence can be put to wrongful use in the world.
QUEST_20170420_005908	The Wizard Master used to be considered the least gifted among the magic Masters.{nl}Her current skill, however, is no lesser than that of any talented Master.{nl}I admire her effort.
QUEST_20170420_005909	I admire the vision of Abreh Melinn for finding a new point of contact between Clerics and Wizards.{nl}Who else but her would be fit for the position of Pyromancer Master?
QUEST_20170420_005910	Cryomancer Master Aleister Crowley is a very clever man. He may be loyal, but he isn't innocent, and he won't hesitate to deceive others for his own benefit. That is all I have to say about him.
QUEST_20170420_005911	Behind the appearances, Ili Terid, the Psychokino Master, hides a fragile heart and a yearning to have his genius recognized.{nl}This despite him having developed powers before he learned about magic, and being recognized as an outstanding merchant even before his powers manifested.
QUEST_20170420_005912	Winona Ende, the Linker Master, is a genius of the kind that is rare to find even among the most notable figures in magic academia.{nl}In about 170 years, she may very well surpass legends like Lucid Winterspoon and Owyn Dilven.
QUEST_20170420_005913	Larisa will only live as much as the average human being.{nl}Ultimately that is what will keep her from fully developing her genius.
QUEST_20170420_005914	Wican Celestic, the Elementalist Master, is dreaming of a love that is unattainable.{nl}The woman he loves is solely interested in eternal life and does not care for marriage.
QUEST_20170420_005915	The Sorcerer Master may still be young, but she's very concerned about aging and death.{nl}I can't say whether she's going to become an Amzinas, however.{nl}The same is true for the Oracle Master, which could be one of the reasons why Dame Circe does not care for Apolonjia.

QUEST_20170901_006137	Pledge of the Blade Investigator
QUEST_20170901_006138	I can't tell you the full details, but a few of our men were on a mission to retrieve an object stolen from a Loremaster of Goddess Jurate.{nl}The last time we heard from them was near Klaipeda.{nl}We need you to check if there's anyone in West Siauliai Woods who might have seen them.
QUEST_20170901_006139	It can be harder to find clues the more time has passed.
QUEST_20170901_006140	Pledge of the Blade?{nl}Not recently, no. I used to see them around here before the Revelators came.{nl}That was a long time ago, I can't remember that well.
QUEST_20170901_006141	I'm glad to have you on our side, Revelator!
QUEST_20170901_006142	So they were seen in West Woods, very well.{nl}Make sure to ask around again tomorrow, someone else might have seen them.
QUEST_20170901_006143	Give Reward
QUEST_20170901_006144	Titas told me.{nl}You're looking for the Pledge of the Blade, is it?
QUEST_20170901_006145	Yes, I have come across them in the past.{nl}It was before the area became infested with monsters, I can only imagine where they might be now.
QUEST_20170901_006146	Oh! One of them asked if we'd seen anyone from the outside recently and I told them I saw a group of people who looked like they were coming from the beach.
QUEST_20170901_006147	Do you think the mercenaries were trying to find them?{nl}I suppose you'll have to keep chasing them to find out.
QUEST_20170901_006148	This is a cryptogram from our group.{nl}It says...
QUEST_20170901_006149	The people they were chasing were a pirate crew.{nl}They fought amongst each other for the stolen goods, then some of them were killed trying to escape with the loot.{nl}Our mercenaries followed them to the Siauliai East Woods.
QUEST_20170901_006150	Is this the cryptogram your brought from the East Woods?
QUEST_20170901_006151	There isn't much to it.{nl}It says the traces of the pirates end in the East Woods.
QUEST_20170901_006152	Hmm...
QUEST_20170901_006153	It says they found the pirates and defeated them. But there are no signs of the stolen objects.
QUEST_20170901_006154	This one says they found the location of the objects.
QUEST_20170901_006155	They realized some of the crew members were missing after the dispute.{nl}They assumed they had stolen the goods and followed the pirates' trace.{nl}They moved to the Miner's Village.
QUEST_20170901_006156	That's what it says.
QUEST_20170901_006157	You're looking for the Pledge of the Blade, you say?{nl}Hmm...
QUEST_20170901_006158	Oh! I remember.{nl}A long time ago they came to the mine looking for some pirates.{nl}I told them I hadn't seen no pirates, so they asked if I'd seen any outsiders who looked like they were hurt.
QUEST_20170901_006159	But, you know, it was a lot worse back then so those kinds of people were everywhere.
QUEST_20170901_006160	It seems like the pirates disguised themselves.{nl}Please check the village for any more clues.
QUEST_20170901_006161	It appears they found one of the pirates hidden among the refugees and the two groups battled.{nl}They were hurt, but not severely, then they followed the pirate crew to the inside of the mine.
QUEST_20170901_006162	They managed to corner the pirates in Crystal Mine 2F, but in order to avoid any more victims, they were looking to send their weapons to Klaipeda.
QUEST_20170901_006163	A group of mercenaries?{nl}That was a long time ago, was it?
QUEST_20170901_006164	I remember a group of rugged-looking fellows walking up and down the streets, if anyone's seen them it'll be the town merchants.
QUEST_20170901_006165	We ought to speak with the merchants.{nl}I'll check with the other residents.
QUEST_20170901_006166	I did have a few merchants here looking for mining gear.{nl}A few days later they came back wanting to buy something for mountain climbing, said they were going to Srautas Gorge.
QUEST_20170901_006167	Srautas Gorge?{nl}They were either following the pirates there or escaping from them.
QUEST_20170901_006168	Pledge of the Blade?{nl}Yeah, they went to Gele Plateau!{nl}There were other people looking for them at the time, though.{nl}Are they back?
QUEST_20170901_006169	So the mercenaries headed to Gele Plateau.{nl}Someone was after them.{nl}I was the only one sent to look for them, meaning...{nl}Whoever it was, they're related to their disappearance.
QUEST_20170901_006170	This... it says the mercenaries were attacked by an unknown group!{nl}Fortunately they managed to escape.{nl}We should check whether there are any signs of a battle near the cryptogram.
QUEST_20170901_006171	Some of our men use arrows, but ours don't look like this.{nl}We don't use this kind of arrowhead.{nl}We need to find the source of these arrows.
QUEST_20170901_006172	You want me to look at an arrow?{nl}Let's see, then...
QUEST_20170901_006173	I'm no Fletcher Master, but this looks like the arrowheads used by Scouts.
QUEST_20170901_006174	If these are Scout arrows...{nl}We should ask Scout Submaster Suina in Orsha.
QUEST_20170901_006175	This arrowhead...
QUEST_20170901_006176	I don't think I'm the right person to talk about this.{nl}The Ranger Master should be able to tell you more about it.
QUEST_20170901_006177	Does this mean the Ranger Master knows about the battle?{nl}What on earth could have happened to our mercenaries...
QUEST_20170901_006178	Are you saying you found this arrowhead in Gele Plateau?
QUEST_20170901_006179	I think I know what happened...
QUEST_20170901_006180	This is a bit embarrassing, but I need to pay back some cash to Olfas Grimm and I agreed to send a few of my archers to Gele Plateau if he cut my debt in half.{nl}He wanted me to get some kind of compass.{nl}I guess that's how they ran into the Pledge of the Blade.
QUEST_20170901_006181	I don't know what happened exactly, but clearly I was in the wrong here so I'll make sure to apologize to Guerra and his men in person.
QUEST_20170901_006182	I see.{nl}But if they all escaped with only a few injuries, they should have returned by now.{nl}To where did they disappear?{nl}I ought to report this to Guerra and go look for them myself.
QUEST_20170901_006183	Thanks to you, at least now I know where they went.{nl}We appreciate your assistance.
QUEST_20170901_006184	I'm going to investigate a few things before I leave.{nl}Again, thank you.
QUEST_20170901_006185	Are you the Revelator that's been defeating the demons?{nl}If that's fine with you, I could use some help in searching for my mercenaries who went missing.
QUEST_20170901_006186	Traces
QUEST_20170901_006187	This looks suspicious.

QUEST_20170912_006191	This is a bit embarrassing, but I need to pay back some cash to Olfas Grimm and I agreed to send a few of my archers to Gele Plateau if he cut my debt in half.{nl}He wanted me to get some kind of compass.{nl}I guess that's how they ran into the Pledge of the Blade.
QUEST_20170912_006192	I may not have much in stock, but I only have what's good!{nl}Have a look.
QUEST_20170912_006193	Jurate's Kupole
QUEST_20170912_006194	Jurate's Compass was lost in the battle with the demons.{nl}It disappeared at sea, no one knows where it is now.{nl}I am trying to find the compass with the goddess' divine power, but the detector seems to be attracting monsters.{nl}Would you help me watch over it?
QUEST_20170912_006195	If only I can get the detector to work, I can find out where the compass is.{nl}Will you help me?
QUEST_20170912_006196	The detector isn't sensing anything.{nl}I suppose I need to search in a bigger area.{nl}Thank you for your help.

QUEST_20171128_006483	Linas
QUEST_20171128_006484	I don't think the Matador Master went anywhere too far from here.
QUEST_20171128_006485	I'm not sure where the Matador Master went, but I believe she was headed somewhere in the region of Fediman.

QUEST_20171128_006488	I did hear that the Matador Master was headed somewhere, although I can't remember exactly where she was going.{nl}I don't think she was leaving the region of Fedimian.
QUEST_20171128_006489	She had something to do in Fedimian.

QUEST_20171128_006494	When the Matador Master was here we didn't have to worry about the monsters...{nl}Now that she's gone, I don't know what we'll do.
QUEST_20171128_006495	It was easy going out to gather wood when the Matador Master was here.{nl}Without her around, things get a little more difficult.
QUEST_20171128_006496	I felt a lot safer when the Matador Master was around.{nl}Ever since she left, the people at the village have been so worried.
QUEST_20171128_006497	Matador Master
QUEST_20171128_006498	The moves of a Matador can be bold and flashy, but they aren't without risks.{nl}Arrogance and low concentration are two things you have to avoid as a Matador.
QUEST_20171128_006499	So you saw my notice? Hm...{nl}I used to accept anyone as my assistance, but people had a hard time adapting to the techniques. They can get kind of difficult, not to mention dangerous.
QUEST_20171128_006500	Then I heard there was a Tetriox roaming around Fedimian, so I came thinking I could get rid of it and teach the soldiers some of my techniques, maybe look for an assistance here.
QUEST_20171128_006501	I figured someone with a military background would do better than a regular civilian.
QUEST_20171128_006502	I still need some tools to train the soldiers with, though.
QUEST_20171128_006503	I asked the merchants around here, but the tools haven't arrived yet.
QUEST_20171128_006504	Are you saying you want to help? I have nothing against that, of course.{nl}Well, first, the accessory merchant in Fedimian is going to get me something that looks like Tetriox horns.
QUEST_20171128_006505	The swords, spears and harpoons are being made by the blacksmith in Orsha.{nl}I also need some leather for the Companions to wear, so I asked the Companion Trader in Orsha for that.
QUEST_20171128_006506	Finally, the merchant in Klaipeda is making the cape we need to lure the beast.
QUEST_20171128_006507	It'd be great if you could give them a little reminder.{nl}If things work out, I'll make sure to tell you a thing or two about becoming a Matador.
QUEST_20171128_006508	You came for the thorns the Matador Master requested?{nl}Well, outside of Fedimian there's nothing but monsters.
QUEST_20171128_006509	Not only that, for the kind that she wants I need actual Blue Hohen Gulak horns.{nl}It's almost impossible to find a whole Blue Hohen Gulak horn these days.{nl}I don't know I'm supposed to finish this.
QUEST_20171128_006510	These are... Blue Hohen Gulak horns! How did you get these?
QUEST_20171128_006511	You must really be something special if you defeated a monster just for this.{nl}Thanks to your help I can finally get on with the Matador Master's request.
QUEST_20171128_006512	I'll finish the horn shape the Master wants and deliver it to her myself.
QUEST_20171128_006513	I need to find some Blue Hohen Gulak horns.
QUEST_20171128_006514	So you're here to check on the weapons I'm making for the Matador Master.{nl}Well... to make the weapons I need an ore that only exists in Nevellet Quarry.{nl}But going there is way more dangerous than I would like.
QUEST_20171128_006515	These days, not many people are willing to risk their lives going to Nevellet Quarry.
QUEST_20171128_006516	This is iron ore.{nl}Did you get it yourself?
QUEST_20171128_006517	I can't believe you got this for me.{nl}Now I can use the ore to make the weapons for the Matador Master.{nl}I'll deliver the weapons to her myself when they're finished.
QUEST_20171128_006518	I need to go find that iron ore.
QUEST_20171128_006519	This should be enough Blue Hohen Gulak horns.
QUEST_20171128_006520	So the Matador Master sent you here to bother me, did she?{nl}Well, I would love to send her the Companion armor she ordered, but I'm out of stock now.
QUEST_20171128_006521	There was a merchant called Rimantas who I used to buy them from, but we lost contact after Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20171128_006522	Last time I heard about him, he was on his way to Orsha.{nl}I don't know if he stopped by Lemprasa Pond but never arrived, or if he didn't come at all, but I couldn't find him again.
QUEST_20171128_006523	I need to find Rimantas.
QUEST_20171128_006524	Rimantas
QUEST_20171128_006525	I saw my village destroyed by monsters and left to look for a refuge.{nl}I was desperate, but thanks to the Orsha migration orders I gained some hope.
QUEST_20171128_006526	It sounds like the Matador Master is hoping for too much.{nl}In my situation, what does she expect?
QUEST_20171128_006527	{nl}I barely have enough tools to make new Companion equipment, and I have no materials at all.
QUEST_20171128_006528	I would need to find some materials, but to make something fit for the Matador Master, they need to be of excellent quality.{nl}Unfortunately, no one these days sells that kind of materials, they're too rare.
QUEST_20171128_006529	Do you really mean it?{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006530	To make the Companion armor, I need leather that's light but strong enough not to rip or scratch when attacked by monsters.
QUEST_20171128_006531	I need some Cockatrice Leather, Beetow Feelers and Minivern Skin in good condition.{nl}The problem is, since these are monster materials, they're not sold on the market.
QUEST_20171128_006532	Let me give you a note with all the materials.
QUEST_20171128_006533	You picked all these quality materials in such a short time?{nl}I can make great Companion armor for the Matador Master with these.
QUEST_20171128_006534	I'll make sure to have the Companion equipment delivered to Toras as soon as I'm finished.
QUEST_20171128_006535	I'm going to need more materials.{nl}This won't be enough for the amount of armor the Matador Master requested.
QUEST_20171128_006536	Rimantas' Note
QUEST_20171128_006537	- 50 pieces of good quality Cockatrice leather (from the Cockatrice monsters in Fedimian Suburbs){nl}- 160 sturdy Beetow feelers (from the Beetow monsters in the Klaipeda region). 
QUEST_20171128_006538	- 75 pieces of strong Minivern skin (from the Miniverns found inside the Mage Tower).
QUEST_20171128_006539	My village turned to ruins when the monsters got there.{nl}I managed to escape to the city, but now I don't really know what to do.
QUEST_20171128_006540	I didn't want to stop working, so I've been doing any sowing job that pops up.
QUEST_20171128_006541	Do you mean the Matador Master's request?{nl}Yes, I was still a little shaken after I escaped.
QUEST_20171128_006542	I was just starting to get settled when the Master came and asked me to sow the capes for her.{nl}At first I didn't want to take the order, because I have no way of getting the silk cocoons I need to make the capes.
QUEST_20171128_006543	But the Matador Master was so determined on getting her capes, in the end I couldn't refuse her.
QUEST_20171128_006544	To get the cocoons I would need to go all the way to the Emmet Forest, but these days it's just too dangerous to go outside.
QUEST_20171128_006545	Let's get some cocoons from Emmet Forest.
QUEST_20171128_006546	You brought the cocoons!{nl}I'll start working on the Matador Master's capes right away. When they're done, I'll deliver them to her myself.
QUEST_20171128_006547	The merchants told me you helped them get the materials for my requests.{nl}As promised, it's my turn to help you get into the Matador life.
QUEST_20171128_006548	Just come see me any time you want to learn.
QUEST_20171128_006549	I'll make sure to have the Companion equipment delivered to Toras as soon as I'm finished.
QUEST_20171128_006550	Hm?{nl}Are you looking for something?
QUEST_20171128_006551	A new request?{nl}Are you asking for a special kind of request?
QUEST_20171128_006552	Well, I'll let you know if any special requests come in.
QUEST_20171128_006553	May I help you?{nl}Are you looking for a special request?
QUEST_20171128_006554	I knew you'd come looking for a special request.{nl}Unfortunately I don't have what you're looking for.
QUEST_20171128_006555	You're here to ask about that special request again, aren't you?
QUEST_20171128_006556	I don't have the special request you're looking for.{nl}Try asking Receptionist Ramda, Liam or Donnes about it.
QUEST_20171128_006557	A special request came in, just like the one you're looking for.{nl}It's a request from the Buller Marker Master, but I can't tell you the details right now.
QUEST_20171128_006558	The Bullet Marker Master is at the Greene Manor, he'll tell you what you need to know.
QUEST_20171128_006559	You heard about the request from Rota, did you?{nl}Well, it's kind of a long story; do you have time?
QUEST_20171128_006560	I was in Sekta Forest with a colleague looking for gun powder materials when we saw a Blue Lepusbunny.{nl}Any other Lepusbunny would have jumped right at us, but that one just... went away.
QUEST_20171128_006561	I thought it was weird that a monster would do that, then I noticed a kind of golden dust falling off of it.
QUEST_20171128_006562	I needed to find out what that was all about.{nl}Then I thought, "If word gets out that there's a golden dust monster around, all the villagers in the area are gonna come running."
QUEST_20171128_006563	I don't want this monster hurting any greedy gold diggers, you know?
QUEST_20171128_006564	So I was wondering what to do about this monster.{nl}I noticed a few other monsters with this golden dust falling off of them: some Red Spions and Firents in Salvia Forest and Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20171128_006565	I just know these monsters are gonna be trouble if I don't do anything about it.{nl}So I made special bullets to make them stop spewing gold dust everywhere.
QUEST_20171128_006566	Unfortunately, things with my colleague got a little rough when I was developing the bullets.{nl}He thinks I'm gonna do something weird with the dust or something, so he wants a third party to do it now.{nl}It was kinda rude of him to suspect me, to be honest, but I agreed to hand it over to Manager Rota.
QUEST_20171128_006567	And that's why you're here.{nl}Miss anything?
QUEST_20171128_006568	Did you talk to the Bullet Marker Master?
QUEST_20171128_006569	Okay, let me give you the Master's recipes for the Frost Bullets, Fire Bullets and Lightning Bullets.
QUEST_20171128_006570	Also, the other person in charge of the request asked me to tell you to carry this surveillance orb with you at all times.{nl}Bad things will happen if you and this orb stay apart for even one moment before the mission is complete.
QUEST_20171128_006571	I would've done it myself, you know, but the other guy and I don't really see eye to eye.
QUEST_20171128_006572	You're done? Already?{nl}Man, you're a blessing.
QUEST_20171128_006573	{nl}If you had no problem making those Frost, Fire and Lightning Bullets, I'm sure you're good enough to get started on the ways of the Bullet Marker.
QUEST_20171128_006574	If you ever want to learn the ways of the Bullet Marker, you know where to find me.
QUEST_20171128_006575	Okay.{nl}Here's what you need to do.
QUEST_20171128_006576	Shoot the Frost Bullets at the Red Spions in Salvia Forest and the Fire Bullets at the Firents in Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20171128_006577	The Lightning Bullets are for the Blue Lepusbunny monsters in Sekta Forest.{nl}They have a strange glow going on under their feet, so you'll know when you see them.{nl}But you gotta make those bullets yourself.
QUEST_20171128_006578	My suspicious colleague gave all my bullet recipes to Manager Rota, so she's the one who has them now.
QUEST_20171128_006579	You'll need to go see Manager Rota at the Mercenary Post and get the special bullet recipes from her.
QUEST_20171128_006580	You'll need a material called Demon Magic Dust for all the bullets.{nl}There's a magic aggregator installed at the Shaton Reservoir that gives out a reddish light.{nl}Get rid of some monsters around it when the light is on and add their flesh.
QUEST_20171128_006581	Then, the flesh will come out of the aggregator as Demon Magic Dust.
QUEST_20171128_006582	For the Frost bullets you'll need Pure Frost Fragments, which you can get from Ice property monsters.
QUEST_20171128_006583	For the Fire bullets you need some Pyrite. You can buy that from the Pyromancer Master.
QUEST_20171128_006584	You're also going to need some Electric Stones from Grynas Trails, but it's hard to tell them apart from normal stones with the naked eye.{nl}You have to use this special latern I made, which makes them glow when you shine it on them.
QUEST_20171128_006585	Here's the lantern, now you only need to get the bullet recipes from Rota.
QUEST_20171128_006586	Bullet Marker Master's Memo

QUEST_20171128_006591	You're also going to need some Electric Stones from Grynas Trails, but it's hard to tell them apart from normal stones with the naked eye.{nl}You have to use the special latern I gave you, which makes them glow when you shine it on them.

QUEST_20171128_006645	What must happen will happen.{nl}Beholder, you have already played your part.{nl}You may go now.
QUEST_20171128_006646	You and your goddess are going to be really disappointed...{nl}Just wait and see.
QUEST_20171128_006647	And you, human.{nl}Don't even think about sticking your nose in our business.{nl}This isn't your world, understand?
QUEST_20171128_006648	The same is true for you, Beholder.
QUEST_20171128_006649	At last...{nl}Today, I dispel the shadows cast upon us.{nl}This shall be the last our world will ever see of Giltine.
QUEST_20171128_006650	She is coming.{nl}Begin.
QUEST_20171128_006651	What... what happened?{nl}Did Giltine escape my trap?!
QUEST_20171128_006652	Where is she now?
QUEST_20171128_006653	It can't be...{nl}...
QUEST_20171128_006654	Giltine can't have escaped.{nl}I must find her!
QUEST_20171128_006655	I must ask for your help once again.{nl}I must find Giltine.{nl}Please, I cannot allow her to steal those records.
QUEST_20171128_006656	Please!
QUEST_20171128_006657	The Kupoles and I prepared the most secure seal to entrap Giltine.{nl}However she saw through my plans and sent a servant in her place.{nl}But I cannot let her escape.
QUEST_20171128_006658	Giltine is after the Revelation Laima has hidden in Valandis Room 91.{nl}When she enters the room, we will activate the seal.{nl}The seal will forever imprison Giltine and the Revelation inside the room.
QUEST_20171128_006659	Do you understand?{nl}With Giltine gone from our world, there will be no need for you to collect the Revelations.{nl}Humans will be free from the threat of demons, and I and the other goddesses shall return to our due places.
QUEST_20171128_006660	Many assorted records are kept inside Valandis Room 91.{nl}I haven't had the chance to see what they contain...{nl}But I don't believe Giltine will find any clues to escape the seal in them.
QUEST_20171128_006661	I would like you to assist me in activating the seal.{nl}Return to me when you are ready.
QUEST_20171128_006662	I must say, your courage is inspiring...
QUEST_20171128_006663	I'm sure you're here for the Revelation.
QUEST_20171128_006664	I wonder what your poor goddess must be thinking.{nl}Laima, goddess of destiny.
QUEST_20171128_006665	All your petty hopes... It's all in my hands now.{nl}I cannot wait to show Laima the Revelation myself.{nl}Along with her miserable minions.
QUEST_20171128_006666	And you, human. I'm afraid this is the end of your journey.{nl}The Revelator who couldn't save the Revelation. How unfortunate!

QUEST_20171128_006669	Found an abandoned book.
QUEST_20171128_006670	Picked up the abandoned book.
QUEST_20171128_006671	This is a catastrophe.{nl}I was far too lenient.{nl}I'm certain now that Giltine's goal is to steal Laima's Revelation in Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_20171128_006672	I must stop her.{nl}I will use the Revelation to lock Giltine in Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_20171128_006673	What is this? A surprise visit?
QUEST_20171128_006674	Didn't expect to run into you here.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006675	Oh, that human, yeah. Is that why you came to see me?
QUEST_20171128_006676	What, do you think I'm just gonna give you what you want?{nl}Not when I have the chance to get something from you.
QUEST_20171128_006677	An unknown energy is felt around the Crystal Stone. Could it be... magic?
QUEST_20171128_006678	We should be able to erase the magic now.{nl}Do it, and absorb the magic into the orb.
QUEST_20171128_006679	Demon Lord Solcomm
QUEST_20171128_006680	I had been observing you since the Crystal Stone broke, but to see you use that human...{nl}You already took what was inside the Crystal Stone. What is it that you want from me?
QUEST_20171128_006681	We finally meet. I'd say your failed attacks on the Astral Tower were bad enough of an offense, don't you think?{nl}Consider yourself lucky I'm not going to talk about all of your pathetic mistakes in front of the human.
QUEST_20171128_006682	Do your duty as a subject of Giltine and give up the contents of the Crystal Stone.{nl}It's the least you can do to save whatever's left of your dignity. 
QUEST_20171128_006683	I need the Stone to attack the Astral Tower. I will not give it to anyone without direct orders from Baiga.{nl}And I will not allow you to doubt me for even one moment. Not when I sacrificed everything I have for this attack!
QUEST_20171128_006684	This looks like a good spot to take note of the surroundings.
QUEST_20171128_006685	Oh, you're better than I though. A bomb like that is enough to destroy it, no doubt.{nl}Alright, go and destroy the Crystal Stone.
QUEST_20171128_006686	Think carefully before you receive this, as it can only be received once per team.{nl}Are you sure you want to receive this item?
QUEST_20171128_006687	Very well, it's all yours then.{nl}May it guide your new path under the goddesses' blessing.
QUEST_20171128_006688	Very well. You can take your time, there's no need to hurry this decision.
QUEST_20171128_006689	You look like you have something to ask me.{nl}Go ahead, I'll answer as best as I can.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006690	You... saw some strange shadows at the Memorial? Hm...{nl}I can't imagine what it could be, but it's hard to be sure just from hearing about it.
QUEST_20171128_006691	Shadows... Now that I think about it, there is someone who should be able to help.{nl}Her name is Eclipse Ubik, she's the Shadowmancer Master.
QUEST_20171128_006692	She has been busy with her research. I believe she is at Lake Rasvoy.{nl}If you do see her, make sure to tell her I sent you and talk to her about the shadows.
QUEST_20171128_006693	Shadowmancer Master
QUEST_20171128_006694	Excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm very busy with work.{nl}Would you mind explaining why you're here?{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006695	The Chronomancer Master sent you? Hm... Then you must have a question for me.{nl}Very well. What is it? I'm listening.
QUEST_20171128_006696	Excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm very busy with work.{nl}Would you mind explaining why you're here?{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006697	I see. I do have an idea of what might be causing shadows like that.{nl}Unfortunately I've been far too busy with my research to do anything else.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006698	I do have something to propose to you.{nl}If you follow along, you might learn something about that phenomenon you experienced. 
QUEST_20171128_006699	I am interested in observing solar and lunar eclipses and analyzing their effects, you see.{nl}I installed a series of devices in different locations in order to study them.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006700	My devices need to be checked regularly, and now is the time to do it.{nl}What you will need to do is retrieve the devices, and then collect traces from nearby shadows.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006701	Shadow traces can be collected from materialized shadows, like the ones you saw.{nl}Just as different monsters develop in different environments, shadows also look different from region to region.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006702	To obtain the shadow traces, you need to understand the characteristics of each region's shadows.{nl}In this way, you can find more about the shadows themselves, and about the phenomenon you saw.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006703	You must be careful not to let any devices or traces influence each other.{nl}After retrieving one set of traces, please wait some time before moving on to the next device.
QUEST_20171128_006704	If you have any questions about the characteristics of the shadows in each region, do ask.{nl}I will do my best to answer.
QUEST_20171128_006705	You did a lot better than I expected, I must say. Well done. You can hand that over to me.{nl}I need to check the results.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006706	Hm... The results are different in one of the locations.{nl}I'm going to need to investigate further.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006707	Thank you for your effort. Oh, and you found the cause of the phenomenon I was going to teach you.{nl}What you saw were shadows that received influence from the devices you brought to materialize themselves.
QUEST_20171128_006708	I do believe that you are fit to handle the magic of shadows.{nl}If you are ever interested in becoming a Shadowmancer, I will be here continuing my research.
QUEST_20171128_006709	It disappears when you try to touch it. What is it...?{nl}The Chronomancer Master ought to know something, let's go to Stele Road and ask her.
QUEST_20171128_006710	Are you wondering about the shadows and how they're different from region to region?{nl}Very well, what do you want to know?
QUEST_20171128_006711	The devices of Khonot Forest are south of the Valle Crossroads.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006712	The shadows in Khonot Forest are sensitive to the presence of humans, and they will run away if you try to approach them.{nl}In order to contact them, you must become a shadow yourself.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006713	I left a transformation device near the research device so future students could use it in my turn.{nl}The transformation devices allows you to temporarily turn into a shadow in order to approach other shadows.
QUEST_20171128_006714	Once you've transformed into a shadow, approach them and capture them.{nl}Doing this will yield shadow traces.
QUEST_20171128_006715	The device of Lhadar Forest is at the hill between Tjibes Refuge and Bethez Refuge.{nl}The shadows there usually aren't visible from up close.
QUEST_20171128_006716	Sometimes you will see the device glow with a blue light.{nl}If you activate the device then, all the shadows in the region will appear very clearly.
QUEST_20171128_006717	The influence these shadows receive plays a much larger role in how they appear compared to other regions.{nl}If you see a shadow, you should continue looking for shadows of the same influence.
QUEST_20171128_006718	Increase the influence and you will receive the shadow traces you need.{nl}That influence decreases when you capture a shadow of a different influence.
QUEST_20171128_006719	The Ziburynas device is at the Kyrba Lot.
QUEST_20171128_006720	The shadows in Ziburynas Forest are rather dull, despite what they may look like.{nl}You can easily scare them into dropping the traces you need.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006721	Oh, but there are some who do enjoy scaring people, and they will try to scare you instead.{nl}Be careful not to fall for their pranks when you're in the region.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006722	I understand it sounds a little unorthodox, but they're simply ways to make yourself more familiar with the shadows.{nl}Alright, you're ready to go find the traces now.
QUEST_20171128_006723	The Namu Temple Ruins device is at the Ratas Corridor Area.
QUEST_20171128_006724	The shadows you'll meet at the Namu Temple Ruins are mostly docile.{nl}Some shadows will sense your presence and disappear when you approach them.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006725	You must step near them enough times in order to receive their traces.{nl}Although, as I mentioned, there are a few deviant ones.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006726	Some shadows will believe you are bothering the others and they will try and capture you.{nl}They can't do much harm, but they can interfere with you finding the shadow traces if they do get a hold of you.
QUEST_20171128_006727	There's an unknown device.
QUEST_20171128_006728	The Chronomancer Master thinks the Shadowmancer Master will know about the strange phenomenon.{nl}Let's go to Lake Rasvoy and find her.
QUEST_20171128_006729	Old Machine
QUEST_20171128_006730	Found an old machine.{nl}It looks like it can still work. Try and turn it on?
QUEST_20171128_006731	Hazy Sphere
QUEST_20171128_006732	The haze in the sphere feels more and more like an evil energy.{nl}Could there be a way to remove it?

QUEST_20171128_006741	The star fragments are beautiful.{nl}Could there be a place to collect them?
QUEST_20171128_006742	Mysterious Pot
QUEST_20171128_006743	There's a strange, old-looking pot.
QUEST_20171128_006744	Can it hold the star fragments?
QUEST_20171128_006745	It looks like a normal pot.{nl}The inside of it is pitch black.
QUEST_20171128_006746	The pot looks like it can hold the star fragments.{nl}Inspect the pot?
QUEST_20171128_006747	The pot is not reacting.{nl}It seems to react only to the star fragments.
QUEST_20171128_006748	Star Fragment

QUEST_20171128_006752	Castle Dungeon (Recommended Lv : 300){nl}Only you and your party members can enter together.{nl}Do you want to enter?
QUEST_20171128_006753	I'll see what I can do.
QUEST_20171128_006754	Aahh... I'm under attack.
QUEST_20171128_006755	Demon King Kartas is using the power of the Kruvina to contaminate the earth and change the very nature of this place.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006756	This land was created after Medzio Diena. Their goal is to turn in into demon territory and create a settlement here.{nl}You must stop them.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006757	They are launching attacks on Sorfus Coast as well.{nl}I have the Loremasters to assist me there, but things are looking bleak.
QUEST_20171128_006758	In this continent, you are the most powerful Revelator I can trust.{nl}Please, destroy the Massive Kruvina on Eperotao Coast.
QUEST_20171128_006759	The area has been occupied by the Nimrah and the Varle by order of Kartas. It won't be an easy task.{nl}{nl}That is why I trust only you to reclaim this coast from the demons.
QUEST_20171128_006760	The Massive Kruvina is protected by other demon devices and by the power of the demon lord.{nl}Loremaster Ugnius is carrying one of my relics, but its power alone will not suffice.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006761	There is another relic of mine that has been sealed by demons in Aitheo Coast.{nl}If we can combine the power of the two relics, we can match the power of the Kruvina.
QUEST_20171128_006762	The fate of the coast lies in your hands.
QUEST_20171128_006763	The Massive Kruvina is releasing a repulsive energy.{nl}It is protected by evil power.
QUEST_20171128_006764	Zealot Master
QUEST_20171128_006765	Strong devotion does not derive from simple belief.{nl}It is only through action that true devotion is proven.
QUEST_20171128_006766	Faith, without action as commanded by the goddesses in the scriptures, is destined to perish.
QUEST_20171128_006767	Tell me, are those who find faith only in words?�the true believers?{nl}When divinity is nowhere to be found, it is our duty as believers to search for it.
QUEST_20171128_006768	It is our duty to attest our faith in the search for the divine.
QUEST_20171128_006769	You saw the tombstones in Vera Coast.{nl}Yes, Vera Coast is part of the realm of Goddess Jurate.
QUEST_20171128_006770	Are you perhaps interested in the doctrines of our order?
QUEST_20171128_006771	Us Zealots have devoted ourselves to searching for the missing goddesses after Medzio Diena.{nl}Our goal as clerics is to fulfill the will of the goddesses through whatever means necessary.
QUEST_20171128_006772	Finding the goddesses is crucial to restoring peace in our world.{nl}We will not hesitate to sacrifice whatever we must in order to find Them. That is what we are willing to do, no matter what it takes.
QUEST_20171128_006773	You seem interested in our order.{nl}I must warn you, we do not shy away from pain or sacrifice when it comes to serving the divine.
QUEST_20171128_006774	We are strongly united in our common goal, and we will perish together if we must.{nl}Are you sure you are interested in joining us?
QUEST_20171128_006775	{s33}{nl}The Zealot Order: Fervor and Devotion{/}
QUEST_20171128_006776	The Zealot order is known for its ardent sense of devotion, or as most would put it, earnest insanity.
QUEST_20171128_006777	In reality, despite their extreme ideas on devotion, Zealots hardly push the limits of what is considered acceptable under the Kingdom's laws. This is especially true when one considers the existence of cleric orders such as the Inquisitors, which are known to effectively carry out their judgment in the name of the goddesses. 
QUEST_20171128_006778	This is about a cleric order called the Zealots.{nl}Maybe an experienced cleric like the Inquisitor Master will know something more about it.
QUEST_20171128_006779	This book includes the back side of the text written on the tombstones you saw.{nl}Return to me after you read it.
QUEST_20171128_006780	I will then test your understanding of our ideology and practices.
QUEST_20171128_006781	Are you ready to prove yourself?
QUEST_20171128_006782	First, I'm going to test your understanding of our order.{nl}Please answer carefully.
QUEST_20171128_006783	What is the most important action we take in combat?{nl}What means do we use to discover the whereabouts of Goddess Laima?
QUEST_20171128_006784	Matters concerning a particular goddess are often the cause of conflict between Zealots and outsiders.{nl}What goddess is that?
QUEST_20171128_006785	Like the Zealots, there is another group concerned with searching for Goddess Jurate.{nl}Who are they?
QUEST_20171128_006786	Take your time to read the book one more time and return when you are ready.
QUEST_20171128_006787	I see you have understood.{nl}It is not a difficult book, I was right to assume you would have no trouble reading it.
QUEST_20171128_006788	I believe you are ready for your final test now.
QUEST_20171128_006789	You want to know about the Zealots?
QUEST_20171128_006790	They're an order with very radical ideas.{nl}It's safe to say they're the most extreme religious order in the Kingdom.
QUEST_20171128_006791	Mind you, that doesn't necessarily mean they're bad or a cult.{nl}They're just very drastic when it comes to exercising their devotion.
QUEST_20171128_006792	Apparently the Zealots are a very radical group.{nl}Maybe the Oracle Master will have more information on them.
QUEST_20171128_006793	The Zealots?
QUEST_20171128_006794	Yes, they're a group dedicated to searching for the missing goddesses.{nl}Their goal is to prove the existence of the divine by finding them.{nl}Laima, Jurate, and the other goddesses...
QUEST_20171128_006795	They believe in proving one's faith by acting in accordance to the will of the goddesses.
QUEST_20171128_006796	It seems their goal is to find the missing goddesses.{nl}It could be worth it to ask the Paladin Master about them.
QUEST_20171128_006797	The Zealots, you say...
QUEST_20171128_006798	Yeah, they have strong beliefs, but I think they're wrong.{nl}They'll use any means they can to find the goddesses, no matter what it is.
QUEST_20171128_006799	More than once there were clashes because of what they insisted was "following the will of Goddess Jurate".{nl}I'm telling you, their views are twisted.{nl}If you're looking for their Master, she should be at the Inner Enceinte District.
QUEST_20171128_006800	It sounds like the Zealots will do whatever it takes to follow the goddesses.{nl}It's probably best to talk to the Master herself.
QUEST_20171128_006801	The divine energy of the forest is felt all around. Everything feels lighter.
QUEST_20171128_006802	There's a tree giving off a strong divine energy.
QUEST_20171128_006803	The divine energy of the forest is felt all around. It protects against evil forces.
QUEST_20171128_006804	The forest is already providing protection.
QUEST_20171128_006805	A sense of blessing is coming from the forest.
QUEST_20171128_006806	The altar seems to contain the power of the goddess.{nl}Let's investigate it.
QUEST_20171128_006807	It looks like the altar can still take more offerings.
QUEST_20171128_006808	It looks like the altar can still take one last offering.
QUEST_20171128_006809	The divine energy of the forest is felt all around. It feels like a protective shield.
QUEST_20171128_006810	The divine power of the altar washes away all evil energy.
QUEST_20171128_006811	Divine energy is gathering at the altar.
QUEST_20171128_006812	There's an old altar.
QUEST_20171128_006813	The power of the goddess is no longer felt at the altar.
QUEST_20171128_006814	The sound of a song is heard coming from somewhere.
QUEST_20171128_006815	There's a barrier of evil energy making it difficult to continue.
QUEST_20171128_006816	There's a tree full of divine energy.
QUEST_20171128_006817	Misery fell unto the forest's... and I... trust Theresi Forest with this injured body...
QUEST_20171128_006818	Which trial are you interested in?
QUEST_20171128_006819	I will give you more time to study.{nl}You may return when you are ready.
QUEST_20171128_006820	Our order's tests are similar in nature to our regular activities.{nl}In fact, the stone plates you found were created to educate future believers.
QUEST_20171128_006821	The stone plates I will ask you to find are hidden in Cranto Coast and Igyti Seashore.{nl}They appear for 30 minutes six times per day. Return to me after you read them.
QUEST_20171128_006822	There are 10 plates in total, but only one is real.{nl}This will be a test to your knowledge and insight.
QUEST_20171128_006823	Cranto Coast and Igyti Seashore.{nl}There are 5 stone plates hidden in each location.
QUEST_20171128_006824	One of them is real and will teach you about the Zealot order. Return after you have understood the information.
QUEST_20171128_006825	The Zealot Order: Fervor and Devotion
QUEST_20171128_006826	The strong devotion that characterizes the Zealots does not currently tend to manifest itself in ways that contradict royal laws or secular standards.{nl}Historically, Zealots have accused demons as the main culprits for the disappearance of the goddesses.
QUEST_20171128_006827	In the past, this has lead Zealots to abduct a number of high-rank demons.{nl}The Zealots proceeded to torture the captured demons, interrogating them about the whereabouts of the goddesses as well as the demons' involvement in the incident.
QUEST_20171128_006828	Their practices remained largely unknown by both the Kingdom and other cleric orders. Is it thought, however, that had they been exposed, the Zealots' cruel torture tactics would have received their fair share of criticism.
QUEST_20171128_006829	In the process of capturing and torturing high-rank demons, the Zealots also committed a number of unintended assassinations.{nl}In some cases, the demons were killed during the Zealots' attempts to abduct them. Unaware of the circumstances, a small section of the general public often supported these apparently calculated murders.
QUEST_20171128_006830	Despite the minimal support obtained, the Zealots continued to be seen mostly in a negative light, which only reinforced their distance from the general population.{nl}This was all despite the fact that their actions were serving the noble purpose or regaining contact with Goddess Jurate.
QUEST_20171128_006831	Unlike Goddess Jurate's Loremasters, the Zealots were determined to solve the problem in their own radical ways.{nl}The order believed that Goddess Jurate's lack of communication was due to the fishing industry and other human intrusions to Her realm.{nl}This lead to Zealots attempting to sabotage not only fishermen, but also the royal navy, pirate crews and any human with a connection to the sea.
QUEST_20171128_006832	Although the Zealots were never entirely wrong in their interpretation of Goddess Jurate's desires, their dubious methods and refusal to adopt a more moderate stance made them generally disliked by the public.
QUEST_20171128_006833	In light of these events, the Kingdom was forced to place several legal restrictions on the Zealots' activities, which contributed to a reduced public opposition to the order, although some aversion remained.
QUEST_20171128_006834	Despite their undisputed devotion, to this day Zealots have been unable to establish themselves as a leading religious order among other clerics due to their extreme, single-minded approach to faith.{nl}It is because of this trait, however, that the order has managed to continue their activities in the Kingdom throughout the eras.

QUEST_20171128_006836	Zealots: A History
QUEST_20171128_006837	{s33}{nl}Zealots: A History{/}
QUEST_20171128_006838	Religious sects can be classified according to two factors: the goddess they serve, and how they serve divinity.{nl}In this aspect, our Zealot order is a rather particular case.
QUEST_20171128_006839	Our order was founded on the desire to take a stronger stance on the then-recent disappearance of the goddesses.{nl}Since the order's early days, our objective has been not to worship the goddesses, but to find Them and return them to humanity.{nl}Should the day come when all the goddesses have been found and their positions restored, it is uncertain what the role of the Zealots will become.{nl}It will be the duty of the future Zealot Master as well as the order's to follow the wishes of the goddesses regarding this matter.
QUEST_20171128_006840	Throughout the history of the Kingdom, three goddesses ??Laima, Jurate and Dahlia ??are known to have disappeared or lost their connection with humanity.{nl}A majority of the Zealot order is concerned with finding Laima and Jurate, although members devoted to Dahlia do exist.{nl}Zealots who dedicate their work to reestablishing contact with Jurate have sharply disassociated themselves from the goddess' Loremasters, of which only a few members remain.{nl}The general perception that Jurate Zealots feel superior to or even ignore Her Loremasters is therefore not entirely wrong.
QUEST_20171128_006841	Historically, the Zealot order has been unable to find support and popularity with the general public.{nl}The Zealots' limited personnel and poor financial stability has led to multiple internal conflicts over the recipients of the order's efforts.{nl}The very nature of the Zealot order, with requires extraordinarily strong will and determination from its members, has more than once been the cause of intense disagreements within the group.
QUEST_20171128_006842	One of such disagreements ultimately brought about the division of our order into two factions around the Kingdom's millennium. Surprisingly, the order was reunified 30 years later with a marriage between the leaders of both factions.{nl}Their daughter is Aliza Tal, the current Zealot Master and representative, in charge of maintaining the order's unity into the next era.{nl}Many expect Tal's term as Zealot Master to consolidate a new direction for the order, one that will ensure a bright future for Zealots after a new Master eventually takes the position.{nl}This is a particularly sensitive issue for Zealots, with the impending generation shift from the supporters of Tal's parents to their own succeeding members of the order.{nl}Ultimately, then, the success of the Zealot order unification will depend on how Aliza Tal approaches her duty as Master, guided by the legacy of her parents.
QUEST_20171128_006843	Fortunately for the order, Aliza Tal has demonstrated excellent conduct in her term as Zealot Master, earning the trust of not only Zealots but other clerics as well.{nl}One could say that, as an order specialized in the search of absent divinity, now more than ever the Zealots possess a relative advantage to other cleric groups that may very well contribute to their growing status in society. 
QUEST_20171128_006844	Zealots and Divine Power
QUEST_20171128_006845	{s31}{nl}Zealots and Divine Power{/}
QUEST_20171128_006846	Like their history and personality, the Zealots' views on divinity are characteristically different from those of other clerics.{nl}Unlike cleric orders which approach and use the divine power of the goddesses through prayer or ceremonies, Zealots, who are devoted to searching for the missing goddesses, rely on no divine figure from which to borrow their power.
QUEST_20171128_006847	As the affiliation to multiple religious sects is not forbidden under the Kingdom's law, Zealots are allowed to use the power of other goddesses to pursue their activities.{nl}This, however, is a rare occurrence, given the Zealots' strongly independent and determined religious mindset.
QUEST_20171128_006848	One method the Zealots have found to circumvent this limitation was to create their own kind of self-sacrificial rite.{nl}The very designation of this method may sound daunting but, to put it simply, Zealots do this by sacrificing their life energy and similar forces to invoke a new power.
QUEST_20171128_006849	As such, although unable to directly use the power of the goddesses, the Zealots' rites allow them to make use of a universal divine power connected to that of the goddesses, or the inherent divine force of the world itself.
QUEST_20171128_006850	Sensing and utilizing this universal divine power are abilities exclusive to those of the Zealot order. This is often presented by Zealots as definitive proof that, despite their lack of direct communication with the goddesses, they remain a recognized cleric order in the eyes of the divinities.
QUEST_20171128_006851	On the other hand, the Zealots' methods of manifesting their abilities by sacrificing life energy and related components are, to this day, not generally accepted among the public or other cleric orders.
QUEST_20171128_006852	The Zealot order itself has shown no intentions of revising its practices, which seems to indicate that it will continue to stand by the uncompromising, self-segregating stance it is known for in the eras to come.
QUEST_20171128_006853	What can I do for you?
QUEST_20171128_006854	Is there anything you need?
QUEST_20171128_006855	This looks like the tombstone the Zealot Master talked about.
QUEST_20171128_006856	This stone says something different from the book.
QUEST_20171128_006857	Part of the content is erased, making it hard to read.
QUEST_20171128_006858	The text is about religious orders.
QUEST_20171128_006859	This stone filled with small text looks a little suspicious.
QUEST_20171128_006860	Found the stone. It's time to return to the Zealot Master.
QUEST_20171128_006861	You found it.{nl}Congratulations, you passed the first test.

QUEST_20171128_006870	You may return to me when you are ready.
QUEST_20171128_006871	Very well, let's begin the final test.{nl}The basis of this test won't be too different from the last.
QUEST_20171128_006872	Find the order's hidden tombstones in Nheto Forest, Svalphinghas Forest and Lhadar Forest.{nl}This time as well, there are 5 per location, only one of them real.
QUEST_20171128_006873	The content of the stone is related to our devotion and use of divine power.{nl}You may start now.
QUEST_20171128_006874	Nheto Forest, Svalphinghas Forest, Lhadar Forest.{nl}There are 15 tombstones, but only one contains true information about our relation with divine power.
QUEST_20171128_006875	You read the last piece of literature.{nl}The first and last pieces were written by an Inquisitor of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20171128_006876	He was not a member of our order, but he studied it and understood it.{nl}We use his book to educate newer members.
QUEST_20171128_006877	I will give you the full book for you to read.{nl}You can return to me when you are ready.
QUEST_20171128_006878	I have one last test for you.{nl}These will be questions about our divine power and the goddesses.
QUEST_20171128_006879	As you know, us Zealots are different from other clerics.{nl}How are we different?
QUEST_20171128_006880	From which goddess do Zealots borrow their divine power?
QUEST_20171128_006881	Through what means do we use our powers as clerics?
QUEST_20171128_006882	What kind of divine force serves as a source for our power?
QUEST_20171128_006883	You have passed the final test.
QUEST_20171128_006884	You have a fine understanding of our history and future objectives.{nl}That knowledge is vital to becoming a true Zealot.
QUEST_20171128_006885	And finally, a Zealot must be faithful and devoted to the order's goals.{nl}You must be determined, even if it destroys you...
QUEST_20171128_006886	If you are sincerely willing to become a member of our order, I as Zealot Master will duly allow it.

QUEST_20171128_006889	Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 1
QUEST_20171128_006890	Eyes open, Laima tried to collect Herself, consciously allowing peace to return to Her.{nl}It was not easy foreseeing in detail all the strings of destiny that were yet to unfold. Before the future happens, there is always the faint chance that it can be changed. But destiny always comes, and when a moment inevitably approaches, it becomes only more difficult to avoid.
QUEST_20171128_006891	Being a goddess did not free Her from the Creator's universal laws. If anything, as a guardian of those laws, She was bound to them more than anyone.{nl}Laima, however, was determined to take action. Time wasn't scarce according to Her premonition, but knowing the future was not enough to reassure Her. Not considering the opponent she was set to face.
QUEST_20171128_006892	Laima knew all too well the thousand-year regret of letting go and missing the chance to change the future.{nl}So She prepared, careful enough not to hurry, but hasty enough not to delay Her plans.
QUEST_20171128_006893	Laima took one last look at the home She had grown so attached to in the past years, the same one She was now determined to abandon.{nl}If what She foresaw was to happen, or because it was to happen, it would be another thousand years before She would return.{nl}And so She tried, though She knew it was in vain, to imprint into Her memory the feel of that place, hoping it would carry out into the long, long millennium.
QUEST_20171128_006894	Her absence would last no longer than a thousand years, of that She was certain.{nl}With a deep sigh, Laima raised Her hand and began to mark on the walls a message, as if writing with light.{nl}Each message engraved would soon fade into the walls without a trace. For Laima, there was nothing left to do then but leave.
QUEST_20171128_006895	With Laima gone, Her estranged sister Giltine would be the first to visit Her abandoned home, or so she foresaw.{nl}One of the messages left engraved on the walls was directed to her, in the hopes that Giltine would abide by it.{nl}Laima felt sorry for the situation She had placed Herself into. Eventually, however, She stepped away from home, and Her thousand-year journey began.
QUEST_20171128_006896	Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 2
QUEST_20171128_006897	Giltine stood in the abandoned home of Goddess Laima. A message, clearly directed to her, appeared briefly on the wall before fading back into nothing. Giltine meditated on the words. Unlike humans, she was unable to forget anything her eyes had seen.{nl}Her thoughts turned to words in her mind before she voiced them out, at once enraged and insulted.{nl}[So you left without even bothering to speak to me. You still think you are right, don't you?]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006898	She continued. [You knew that we would never agree on this, that I would come find you if everything fell through, so you prepared to abandon this place? The place we call our home?]{nl}Giltine's monologue turned into an angry lament. [You're going to roam with the humans now? You're leaving me, making me the enemy? You're running away from the other goddesses, your sisters, to live like that for who knows how long?]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006899	As soon as her words dissipated, Giltine heard a noise coming from behind her.{nl}She turned around to glance at the three demons that had arrived under her command.{nl}On the left stood Kartas; his skin pale and ashy, his deranged eyes glistening.{nl}Knowing him, Giltine believed he might very well be able to chase Laima. Kartas was chaos personified after all, there was no telling what he was capable of. Counting on his tenacious and uncontrolled nature, Giltine knew it was only a matter of time before he could find Her.
QUEST_20171128_006900	On the other hand, Kartas hunted for pleasure and thoroughly enjoyed wreaking havoc. Laima would not die at the hands of Giltine's subordinate, but his destructive impulses seemed like too much of a risk.{nl}She erased from her mind the thought of entrusting Kartas with the goddess. Instead she turned to Baiga, her most trustworthy subordinate. Baiga was discreet, intelligent and powerful, a rare combination among Giltine's followers. Short of a true goddess herself, she knew not to expect perfection from her subordinates. Baiga, however, would not disappoint her.{nl}Capturing a goddess with foreseeing powers would be no easy task. It could take centuries to find Her. And yet, to an immortal being it was not impossible, and Giltine was willing to bet on Baiga to produce the right results.{nl}Unfortunately for her, there was a bigger, more urgent task reserved for Baiga that she could not entrust to anyone else.
QUEST_20171128_006901	 Conformed, Giltine turned her eyes away from Baiga and onto her third demon.{nl}[Gesti, I want you to chase Laima. Do what you must to find her. I will not tolerate a failure.]{nl}Upon hearing Giltine's words, Baiga acquiesced. Kartas clenched his teeth and growled loudly in discontent, gazing intently at his superior. Gesti stepped back on one foot, as if preparing for him to suddenly attack.{nl}Predictably, Kartas seemed fixed on the thought that he would have been chosen for the job if it weren't for Gesti. As someone who did not hesitate to defy Giltine herself, he was remarkably less keen on respecting her other subordinates as fellow demon lords.
QUEST_20171128_006902	Giltine let out a deep sigh and adopted a rigid stance, glancing back at Kartas. A few moments passed before he looked away in defeat. As always, the only way to control Kartas was to overpower him into submission. Other than the goddesses, few were able to do that without collateral damage.{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006903	Now regretting ever having considered Kartas for the important task of finding Laima, Giltine adjusted her posture to speak again.{nl}[Kartas, you stay away from Gesti. You don't want to know what I'll do with you if I catch you out of line. You go to Gesti only if she asks for your help. Do as she says or you will be punished. I will not hesitate to take you down.]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006904	Kartas slowly lowered his head, signaling to Giltine his obedience. No words were directed to Gesti.{nl}If needed, she would call for Kartas or his subordinates. He may not have been as brilliant as Baiga, but Gesti was no fool either. She would be careful not to assign Kartas too big of a role, or push him to the point of releasing his explosive nature.
QUEST_20171128_006905	 Gesti pondered on what task she could entrust to Kartas. Giltine stepped towards her, as if guessing her thoughts.{nl}[Let us leave, before the goddesses realize we came to find Laima.]{nl}Without further discussion, the four demons walked away from the scene, leaving Laima's home empty once again.
QUEST_20171128_006906	Laima's One Thousand Years Vol. 3
QUEST_20171128_006907	Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot. The goddess, on the other hand, had long predicted her actions, and was now more infuriated than ever with the demon's sheer audacity to follow through with them. Laima felt deceived. She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.
QUEST_20171128_006908	Unfortunately for Gesti, not all would go according to her plans.{nl}"How dare you use humans... How dare you even consider associating with those humans!"{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006909	Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot. The goddess, on the other hand, had long predicted her actions, and was now more infuriated than ever with the demon's sheer audacity to follow through with them. Laima felt deceived. She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.
QUEST_20171128_006910	Gesti was entirely uninterested in human politics: who the ruling dynasties were, how the Kingdom was founded, all of it. This was true even after she discovered that Laima had contacted with Zachariel, their founding king.{nl}The goddesses often communicated with their believers, the Kingdom's clerics, through prayer and apparitions. Gesti found this behavior unnecessary, though she was aware of the others' commitment to it.
QUEST_20171128_006911	As Laima immediately met with Zachariel after escaping, Gesti merely saw it as a mundane visit rather than an act of despair.{nl}When she finally understood, the mortal king was already at rest in his tomb. With him, Laima had buried in the royal mausoleum a Revelation containing part of Her powers.{nl}Gesti hurried to the tomb when she realized it, but on arriving she discovered something even more unexpected. The mausoleum was protected by a defense system so sophisticated not even a powerful demon such as herself could ignore it.
QUEST_20171128_006912	King Zachariel had mobilized all of the Kingdom's cleric forces to build a protection system for the mausoleum using the divine power of the goddesses.{nl}With time, the barrier would fade and slightly weaken, but at that moment, Gesti knew it was far too powerful to penetrate, and it angered her beyond words.{nl}She hated being forced to admit it, but she could not overlook the shame of having been outsmarted by Laima. She knew the goddess would continue to rely on humans to stop her, that She would find another way to make them work in Her favor.{nl}But Gesti was determined to carry out her task, through whatever means necessary.
QUEST_20171128_006913	If Gesti was to galvanize large groups the way Laima did, she was going to need help.{nl}She summoned her subordinates. Then, with the authority granted to her by Giltine, she called for Kartas' and Baigas' henchmen.
QUEST_20171128_006914	Gesti saw no reason to hold back from gathering her own demon army if Laima was doing the same with the humans. It was an opportunity to prove themselves superior to their tactics.{nl}Rexipher was the first to answer Gesti's call. Out of her own nine subordinates, she trusted him the most to infiltrate the mausoleum and retrieve the Revelation. If necessary, there were always other demon lords she could rely on for the task, she thought.
QUEST_20171128_006915	Gesti explained the details of the task to Rexipher before dismissing him and the rest of the henchmen. Neither of them could have imagined the thousand-year-long ordeal that task would become. No one but Laima had foreseen the true scale of their situation.
QUEST_20171128_006916	Eminent Vol. 1
QUEST_20171128_006917	A young man walked down the street with steady, cheerful steps. Locals recognized him as the son of their lord and greeted him politely. He responded to each with a kind smile and a friendly word or two. The young man was exceptionally well-mannered for someone of his noble status, which made him a widely respected figure among the people living in his father's lands.
QUEST_20171128_006918	He was particularly remembered for having saved multiple lives during an epidemic that had spread over the region the previous year. The disease took the lives of all his brothers and sisters, leaving only his ailing father and himself in the family. Most believed that, if it weren't for his son's devoted care and attention, the lord too would have perished from the epidemic. Assured by the young nobleman's selfless and respectful nature, the inhabitants of the land looked forward to the day he became his father's successor.
QUEST_20171128_006919	Now the sole descendant of the Eminent family, the young man carried his benevolent ways inside the residence, treating servants and guests alike with utmost kindness.{nl}One day, he carefully entered his father's room and dismissed the servants. The amicable smile soon disappeared from his features. He made sure they were out of hearing distance before drawing closer to the bed.{nl}[They know about my dedication and care now. More than enough, in fact. I think it's time for you to go.]{nl}The lord responded in a strained voice.{nl}[Why must you do this with our family...?]
QUEST_20171128_006920	The young man replied.{nl}[What do you mean? I'm going to bring true prosperity to your family, I'm going to make your name known. If anything, you should be thanking me for even having chosen you.]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006921	[Please, stop trying. What is it that you want to reveal about my true identity? Other than me not being human, you know nothing.]{nl}[What are you?]{nl}[You will die soon, so I will not hide it. I am what you call a demon. A demon lord. I shall not reveal my true name. It is enough for you to know the name of Eminent, your family. When you die, there will be no more Eminents and no more unrest, no more disorder.]{nl}[Why are you after the lands and authority of a human?]{nl}[I have my reasons, but there is no need or time to elaborate.]{nl}Uttering these words, the young man reached out with his hand and lightly touched the other. He was still breathing slowly, his eyes closed. Later, with the servants back in the room tending to him, he would have his last breath. But not now.
QUEST_20171128_006922	The man now set to become the only remaining member of the Eminent family took a few moments to organize his thoughts.{nl}After being tasked with finding Laima's Revelation and realizing the ways in which the goddess had used humans in Her favor, he was determined to plot his own scheme of human domination.
QUEST_20171128_006923	It would seem odd, that the ingenious Rexipher had wasted centuries surrounding that royal mausoleum before considering the thought of infiltrating the humans' society. On the other hand, the fact that he unlike other demons had even conceived such a plan was remarkable, given their proud and reluctant personality.{nl}He didn't know it yet, but his plan would become the foothold to, years later, defeating Laima's chosen guardian for the first time in history.
QUEST_20171128_006924	Eminent Vol. 2
QUEST_20171128_006925	For the first time after Gesti discovered Laima's plans to hand Her Revelations over to posterity, the keeper of a Revelation had been murdered by a demon. Others had been sent by Gesti to complete that very mission, but Premier Eminent had been the first to succeed.
QUEST_20171128_006926	As Lydia Schaffen's arrow burried itself into Ruklys' neck, Premier Eminent looked ready to shout out, 'I won!,' but he did not say a word.{nl}After disguising himself as a human and monopolizing the Kingdom's government from his political position, this was an important victory.{nl}His only grudge was failing to defeat Schaffen and Maven. Their names were far too powerful for him to attempt it without great risks.{nl}With Ruklys gone, all that was left to do was find the Revelation he was guarding. One word to poor King Kadumel was enough to grant Eminent full control over the operations.
QUEST_20171128_006927	He looked set to accomplish the enormous feat of becoming the first demon to seize Laima's Revelation.{nl}Suddenly, Lydia Schaffen made her way towards him. His human self was older than her, but he made the effort to address the acclaimed archer in his usual polite tone.{nl}[I was always sure you would be the one to capture the rebel leader. No general, no officer of the Kingdom but you, Lydia.]{nl}Lydia gave one look at the cunning politician before sighing deeply.{nl}[Next time you can believe I will be keeping my eyes on you. I don't care where you are or what you're doing, you won't be so safe anymore as long as I'm around. Mark my words.]{nl}Had another human spoken to him so brazenly, he would not have hesitated to retaliate. With Lydia, he merely maintained his unassuming expression of years trained in human interaction and spoke in a soft tone.{nl}[You are as proud as the one you killed today, I can tell. I should say, however, that one does not reach my position without a certain level of... competence.]
QUEST_20171128_006928	Eminent and Schaffen peppered their words with the right amount of ambiguity. Their conversation was less and less a dialog between two humans. Lydia spoke next.{nl}[I knew a fool who used to say that... He's still up there, riding my arrow. I don't know if you know him.]{nl}It was true. No demon ??neither the fool she spoke of, nor the highest of demon lords ??had ever crossed her path and survived. Eminent found it hard to believe that would be his fate but, even with his immense power, Lydia was far from an easy target.
QUEST_20171128_006929	Not only that, if there was any human capable of destroying a demon lord, the woman standing in front of him was certainly one of them. Her mentor Maven, on the other hand, was a high-ranked cleric who would stop at no means to defend himself from the demons.
QUEST_20171128_006930	Eminent decided not to respond to Lydia's provocation. In his human form of chancellor Eminent, he was in no way related to her sharp arrows.
QUEST_20171128_006931	Lydia Schaffen's strategy, however, was not to fight physically.{nl}[Do you really think you'll get what you want now that Ruklys is dead? Have you forgotten that I was given the same divine task? If there was any chance of it getting to your hands, do you think he would have died at mine? Your plan will never work. You can be sure of that. But it's time for me to go now. Do me a favor when you deliver the news to His Majesty. Make sure everyone understands exactly what I did.]
QUEST_20171128_006932	Lydia Schaffen bowed and slowly walked away. Eminent wasn't too concerned yet. True despair wouldn't come for him until 10 days later.
QUEST_20171128_006933	Eminent Vol. 3
QUEST_20171128_006934	Emiment kneeled silently before Gesti. They were on the Fortress of the Land Ruklys had once built. Looking down at Eminent, Gesti spoke with despise.{nl}[You scoured through every body of every miserable human in here for years, and you can't tell me where in this fortress it's hidden?]{nl}Eminent replied in an almost inaudible voice.{nl}[Forgive me.]{nl}In his mind, he wondered for a moment if Baiga would have understood his situation better than Gesti. She interrupted his train of thought immediately.{nl}[What are you going to do about it? You're a chancellor to those humans now. If the King calls you back to the court, how are you going to keep looking for it? Huh? Look at you. Does it look like you did a good job, playing human like that? What good is it now, if you can't even do you real job?]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006935	Eminent could no longer stand listening to Gesti berate him in silence.{nl}[As chancellor I have authority over many human subordinates, including armies. Even if I return to the capital, I can send soldiers under my orders to continue looking...]
QUEST_20171128_006936	Angered, Gesti spoke over him.{nl}[And start depending on those filthy humans again? You couldn't find it, but you think they can? What are you even thinking??]{nl}Seeing the ire in Gesti's eyes, Eminent lowered his head. She continued.{nl}[You've been living with them for too long. I want you to stop playing chancellor and focus on your job for once. Just find me the Revelation]{nl}Eminent rushed to answer.{nl}[I remind you that my position would be very useful for keeping humans away while we're searching. I can have the measures taken under my orders, then kill my human character and return to this place immediately to continue the search. Please, allow me to do so.]
QUEST_20171128_006937	Gesti wasn't overly pleased with Eminent's plan, but she agreed to it.{nl}[You were the first to kill Laima's chosen keeper, I suppose. I'll allow it.]{nl}Hearing Gesti's voice soften, Eminent pushed for a second request.{nl}[I have only one more thing to ask.]{nl}[What is it?]
QUEST_20171128_006938	Premier Eminent thought carefully on how to convey his second request to Demon Lord Gesti.{nl}[Many of Ruklys' followers are still living in a city near the fortress called Roxona. My soldiers have been keeping guard at the fortress for now, but they can't do that forever. If we let them be, his followers will try to invade the fortress. But I also can't arrest an entire city...]{nl}[Spare me the details of human society. Just say what you want to do.]{nl}[If you could destroy the city with your powers...]{nl}[Why don't you do it yourself?]{nl}[I certainly could, with the right amount of preparation and the right tools. But annihilating an entire city would call the attention of the goddesses. And then there's the agreement...]{nl}[Didn't you kill everyone in that noble family to get to your position? The goddesses didn't do anything then, why would they care now? I doubt they'll even find out about it.]
QUEST_20171128_006939	Eminent replied.{nl}[Those humans died from an epidemic. It's true that I created the disease and made it spread, but ultimately I didn't kill them. The locals saw me as a virtuous man. Not to mention the scale of that was much smaller than an entire city. This will be a much more serious violation of the agreement in the eyes of the goddesses.]
QUEST_20171128_006940	Gesti was engrossed in her thoughts for a moment. To her, humans were of no particular interest. The same could not be said about the goddesses. Knowing the next step of Giltine's great plan, she did not want to provoke them. But most of all, there was the agreement that could not be broken by either side. They had apologized for minor transgressions before, but to completely disregard the agreement was yet out of the question.
QUEST_20171128_006941	Gesti finally spoke again.{nl}[Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to cast a petrifying curse on the city. In theory, the humans can return to normal when the curse is broken, so they won't be dead. Meanwhile, you can use your authority in the human Kingdom to move the petrified ones to another location. That will keep them away without us needing to kill them. Whatever happens next will be the work of the humans, meaning Zemyna as well will be less likely to suspect us.]
QUEST_20171128_006942	{nl}[Understood. If we can also convince the humans that it's a curse from the goddesses, like the rumors about Ruklys, I don't think anything can stop this plan.]
QUEST_20171128_006943	[You can take care of that yourself, just focus on the goal. Remember, we're not trying to kill Laima's chosen keepers; what we want is the Revelations and nothing more. Be grateful that Giltine hasn't punished you yet, and work harder to finish your job. That's what you really ought to do.]{nl}With these words, Gesti disappeared.
QUEST_20171128_006944	Premier Eminent was finally able to stand again. He was burdened with a heavy task. He did not know yet about the long years he would spend inside that fortress, never reaching success. If he did know, he would have perhaps been slightly consoled by the fact that Laima had been left deeply grief-stricken after Ruklys' death under his false accusations. In the conflict between goddesses and demons, that too was a victory.
QUEST_20171128_006945	Fantasy Library Administration Guidelines
QUEST_20171128_006946	The Fantasy Library is the sacred property of the goddesses, wherein all the knowledge and information of the world is kept. Under the administration of Goddess Vaivora, Library management Kupoles are to understand and abide by the following principles.
QUEST_20171128_006947	1. Every new work of literature must be read and understood by she who is the first to find it. The Kupoles must periodically exchange newly acquired information, and relay it to Goddess Vaivora if proven true by the Library's records.{nl}2. Documents legible only to select Kupoles must be duly investigated for the conditions which restrict said legibility. If no definitive conditions are found, the work must be registered as undefined.
QUEST_20171128_006948	3. Should a document be found missing or in a different location, the Kupoles must be alerted and the document periodically investigated for new or undiscovered conditions of existence.{nl}4. The Kupoles must maintain the Library's documents correctly registered and organized, with any information easily accessible to Goddess Vaivora. This principle should take priority over any other, with the exception of the Library's security.
QUEST_20171128_006949	The Story of Mirtis
QUEST_20171128_006950	Years had passed since Gesti sent her demon lords after Laima, yet they had all failed to find Her. Chasing a goddess that could see into the future was far from an easy task, but lately they had made considerable progress in tracking Her steps.
QUEST_20171128_006951	Eminent was certain Laima had become restless after her chosen keeper Ruklys was assassinated. Mirtis thought otherwise.
QUEST_20171128_006952	It was reasonable to think Laima was slowly losing her powers after creating the first Revelation. Mirtis believed the demon lords were closer to Her than ever before. For one, they had almost caught the goddess in Siauliai Woods. They had since lost track of Her again, but they were confident She was near.{nl}Mirtis, in particular, possessed a means for reconnaissance other demons did not. She had found Laima accompanied by a man in a human prison, and there too she had nearly caught Her.{nl}None of the demon lords, however, had come close enough to Laima to properly confront Her.
QUEST_20171128_006953	Mirtis saw their progress as a positive sign; she was certain She would not escape their grip for much longer. She knew from the glimpses she took of Her that Laima had assumed the form of a weak human child. She did not look as if She could withstand an attack if she were to confront Her.
QUEST_20171128_006954	And so, when Laima was finally sighted in the Crystal Mine, Mirtis hurried to inspect the location for possible escape routes.{nl}She couldn't rule out the possibility of Her using teleportation to flee, either. She modified the mine walls to collapse on any signs of teleportation. Anyone attempting it would become trapped in the mine before they had the chance to escape.{nl}Realizing there were no means left for Laima to exit the mine, Mirtis felt assured and excited.
QUEST_20171128_006955	Perhaps because of this, Mirtis had failed to notice the man that accompanied Laima until She came into sight. She was ready to address Her.{nl}[At last, I become the one to stand before you. Other demon lords have chased your path, only to abandon it without ever seeing your shadow. But now you're here. The curtain has fallen.]{nl}It wasn't Laima, but Cunningham, the man beside Her, who replied.{nl}[Did it cross your mind that we could be the ones waiting for you?]
QUEST_20171128_006956	Mirtis retorted.{nl}[Insolent. Whether you waited for me makes no difference. Our matters do not pertain to you, human. What makes you believe you have the right to impose yourself?]
QUEST_20171128_006957	Mirtis shifted her attention from Cunningham to Laima.{nl}[I have received orders from Giltine to strongly encourage you to surrender the Revelation. Should you refuse, it is my duty to seize it through whatever means necessary. Let us make a peaceful agreement. I am willing to be courteous.]
QUEST_20171128_006958	Laima was once again silent. It was Cunningham who continued.{nl}[We waited for you here precisely because we can no longer escape. Although, if you didn't know yet, this mine has been excavated for centuries.]{nl}[That means...?]{nl}Cunningham replied before Mirtis could finish her sentence.{nl}[It's an old, old mine. The lots with no more crystals are already closed. Even if one collapsed, no one would know someone was ever there, and certainly no one would ever dig there again on purpose.]{nl}[And...?]
QUEST_20171128_006959	Cunningham had his answer ready.
QUEST_20171128_006960	In that moment, the 4 Divine Orbs were used for the first time in history. In the future, they would help fight against the great World Tree disaster. The Divine Orb of Rimgaudas, the first Paladin Master, would also contribute to defeating Mirtis' master Gesti not too far from there. But in that moment, it was Mirtis who fell victim to the Orbs first powerful attack.
QUEST_20171128_006961	Mirtis tried to move, but she realized she no longer felt the passing of time around her. If time was a stream, it now felt like a pond. If time was freezing, she thought, she would move through space. But space, too, had been blocked ??by herself just a few moments earlier, no less. She could do nothing but stay there, unable to move.
QUEST_20171128_006962	She would have tried to escape the influence of the Divine Orb before time stopped still, but her mind, too, was now slowing down to the point where she could no longer control it.{nl}Cunningham waited until she became completely motionless and commented.{nl}[The power of this Orb is remarkable.]{nl}Laima finally replied.{nl}[It is because I am near it. If a human uses it alone, it will not be as powerful.]{nl}[This awful demon isn't going anywhere for a while, that's what's important. But you ought to hurry now. I can take it from here.]{nl}[I would prefer if you did not have to do it.]{nl}[I must. You know so. If the mine isn't destroyed, there's always the chance that other demons, or even humans, can wander upon this place. Not only that...]
QUEST_20171128_006963	Cunningham paused to ponder on his words.{nl}[Not only that, the Orb is set to reappear at a different location after its owner's death. It was you who said so. We mustn't let the Orb stay here, for the sake of our future. If I die here, the Orb will be gone and we will have achieved our goal. I'm certain Ruklys would have approved. He can't have died for the goddesses in vain!]
QUEST_20171128_006964	Grief washed over Laima at the mention of Ruklys' name and she finally agreed with Cunningham. She blessed his noble sacrifice and left the mine. In Her remained the deep sorrow of the memories She had sought to forget.{nl} 
QUEST_20171128_006965	Gesti and Ausura
QUEST_20171128_006966	Gesti worried. She worried constantly about her failed attempts to track down Laima, the important task Giltine had assigned for her, but this time, there was something else on her mind. Kartas, forever under the direct orders of Giltine, was unlikely to be sent our to help her, but she may have to deal with Demon Lord Nebulas, his subordinate. Gesti was not looking forward to that.
QUEST_20171128_006967	Unlike Kartas, Nebulas was virtually uncontrollable. More often than not, his appetite for violence did nothing to help the task at hand. For now, however, she had little choice.
QUEST_20171128_006968	She could not summon another demon lord for the sole purpose of keeping Nebulas on a figurative leash. Neither could she discard Nebulas or return him to Kartas. In the end the fact remained that, without a powerful demon on her side, getting hold of the Revelation seemed all but impossible.{nl}The only way she saw was to have Nebulas regulate his own temper. Gesti was in the middle of agonizing over how to get the unruly demon to behave when she heard steps coming in her direction.{nl}[Master. What is it that occupies your mind?]
QUEST_20171128_006969	The words belonged to Ausura, a demon lord who took orders exclusively from Gesti. Along with Diena Frieblander, Ausura was one of the helpers created by Gesti to manage the demon realm in her absence. She served also as Gesti's advisor, and she was known to be a very devoted demon.{nl}That day, like most other days, she listened carefully to the master's woes before offering her word of advice.
QUEST_20171128_006970	[Would it perhaps be best not to summon him? He is dangerous. If you consider his nature, he seems far more likely to hinder rather than contribute to your goal. There's no telling the sort of damage he could cause.]{nl}[Unfortunately I can't leave him alone, either.]{nl}[Luckily, Nebulas is not without his interests. If you remember, Kartas erased his memories when he created him. Because of this, he is obsessed with finding details of his previous life. Surely that can be used to control him.]
QUEST_20171128_006971	[It's nothing I haven't thought about myself. The problem is that I can't give him what he wants.]
QUEST_20171128_006972	[Perhaps not immediately, but in the future. I will make it my task. Kartas is not the most thorough of personalities, after all. With the right amount of research, I'm sure I will find something he wants. For one, there is the fact that Kartas has kept Nebulas from his memories all along. No other demon lord has ever dared to cross Kartas' will in favor of Nebulas, but if I were to intervene, uncovering the clues of his past would only be a matter of time.]
QUEST_20171128_006973	[Are you willing to do that?]{nl}[In your name, master, yes. For now, I advise you to keep Nebulas under control. He should be released only in circumstances where he cannot compromise the task. Do not worry about him, master.]{nl}Gesti accepted the advice of her loyal servant. Thus the role of Karta's subordinate Nebulas in the search for the Revelation was delayed until what would be known in future eras as Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20171128_006974	Nebulas and Kalejimas
QUEST_20171128_006975	Nebulas found himself suppressing the desire to attack the demon lord standing in front of him. He composed himself as best as he could before finally addressing Ausura.{nl}[So you're saying you found out what I wanted to know, but you're only telling me now.]{nl}Ausura sensed his hostility, but tried to remain collected.{nl}[That information was of no use to you before today, you see.]
QUEST_20171128_006976	[There's no reason I couldn't have gone there before. Wouldn't have been that big of a problem for our masters.]{nl}[I do believe it would have hindered the work we are doing for our masters. However I see no obstacles to it now. I would assume you are free to move there as you wish.]{nl}[It's in Kalejimas, is it?]
QUEST_20171128_006977	[That is correct. Although I must remind you. You mustn't act solely in your own interests. It is extremely important that you retrieve the Revelation that is guarded inside.]{nl}[I know.]{nl}[After all, this is a unique opportunity for yourself. Do not be ungrateful for what destiny has brought you.]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006978	[If what you say is true, shouldn't you have told me that sooner?]{nl}[Only now are the humans occupied in dealing with the disaster. Intervening any sooner would have been too great of a risk.]{nl}[So now I can go find the man in Kalejimas and get the information from him, is it?]{nl}[I must remind you, the keeper of the Revelation as well is or was previously in Kalejimas. Do not forget that.]
QUEST_20171128_006979	[I know. But there's something I don't understand. It makes sense that the man who was in charge of the records of all of the Kingdom's families would know about my ancestors and who I was as a human, but wouldn't that information also be in the actual records? It can't all be in his memory...]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006980	[Of course. But as you know, the humans' Kingdom is already in ruins. Retrieving specific documents would become an even more difficult task.]{nl}[That's because you wasted all this time without telling me!]
QUEST_20171128_006981	Ausura tried as she could to appear indifferent while Nebulas burned with rage.{nl}[I understand that you're agitated, but there is a riot happening at Kalejimas as we speak. If you're to gain any control there, you must hurry.]{nl}[But if this man I'm going to find is no longer working at the records, then who's in charge of them now? Are they still alive? Are you just keeping more information from me?]
QUEST_20171128_006982	Ausura sighed at Nebulas' relentless suspicion.{nl}[The human in charge of the records lived in the capital before the great disaster. However, I must warn you not to go there. These are Gesti's orders. You must focus on Kalejimas. Do not attempt to investigate other locations or engage with any other humans. The chances of discovering any traces of old documents in the Fallen City are minimal. Your only sure lead now lies in Kalejimas.]
QUEST_20171128_006983	Nebulas, refusing to let Ausura have the final word, threw at her one last question.{nl}[Your boss won't say anything if I have it my way in Kalejimas, will she?]{nl}Ausura's response was harsh.{nl}[Gesti has no interest in whatever havoc you wreak there, so long as you retrieve the Revelation.]{nl}
QUEST_20171128_006984	The Story of Solcomm
QUEST_20171128_006985	[Have you called?]{nl}Demon Lord Solcomm stood in front Gesti, the one who had summoned him. Waiting for her reply, he realized once again the complexity of his situation. Formally, he was a servant of Kartas. His work, however, was largely dedicated to Baiga. And yet there he was, awaiting orders from Gesti. A devoted agent for all three of those high-rank demons.
QUEST_20171128_006986	Solcomm's ordeal began with Baiga designating him to work for Kartas in order to spy on the rival demon king. Giltine, their master, had promptly agreed to Baiga's proposal, thinking a reasonable demon such as Solcomm would do well to prevent Kartas' incontrollable nature from getting out of hand.
QUEST_20171128_006987	Some centuries later, Gesti was tasked with chasing Laima, and Giltine allowed her to request the help of other demon lord subordinates, Solcomm included.{nl}The decision did nothing to improve Solcomm's situation. His master used the constant "support missions" and "dispatched operations" as an excuse to achieve what was essentially discarding his least favorite henchmen. Not only that, as the most normal and rational of the lower-ranked demon lords, Solcomm was the obvious choice for Gesti.
QUEST_20171128_006988	A stubborn, deranged character like Warpulis would be of no help to the task at hand.
QUEST_20171128_006989	Having Nebulas around was more than enough. In the end, it was up to Solcomm to accept the new role under Gesti, now his third master.{nl}In the centuries to come, answering to three masters was bound to do more harm than good, he thought. It lowered the chances of any of them truly supporting him.
QUEST_20171128_006990	 His current master Gesti was, unsurprisingly, beginning to show signs of just that. She addressed him.{nl}[Do you know how long we've been looking for Laima's Revelation? It's bad enough that we haven't made any progress, and it's only going to get worse.]{nl}[Why is that?]{nl}[Ever heard of Lydia Schaffen?]
QUEST_20171128_006991	[Yes, I've heard of her. She is exceptionally well-known in the human realm. I don't believe any human in history, not even her mentor Maven, has ever become quite as influential as she.]{nl}[I didn't know you were so keen on human gossip. But alright. What's important is that this woman is guarding Laima's Revelation. And you know what's funny? We know she has it, but we can't even touch her. Every other keeper of a Revelation was either hiding it or protecting it, or at least doing something to keep it off our hands. Maven, the one they call her mentor, is locked inside the Great Cathedral with a Revelation. Tesla, well, he lived for way too long not to be hiding his own Revelation somewhere. His statues are almost as powerful as the goddesses themselves. Even if I catch him, how am I going to interrogate him?
QUEST_20171128_006992	The Beholder thinks Tesla has no Revelation. But Lydia Schaffen is different. This woman is different, I'm telling you.]{nl}Solcomm interceded before Gesti's explanation could get any longer.{nl}[She is different, indeed. She defeated six demon lords in the past 27 years. Completely unheard of for a human. And her arrows! There's not a demon's heart that- ahem, I apologize.]
QUEST_20171128_006993	His words were momentarily cut off by Gesti's piercing look, but soon he continued.{nl}[What I mean is that other humans have absolute faith in her arrows.]{nl}[Yes, they have every reason to. That's the problem.]
QUEST_20171128_006994	Gesti's incredibly rare compliment to a human's power astonished Solcomm. He took the chance to add, [I'm not sure if you're aware, but there is an even greater problem. All the demons she is known for defeating were victims of ingenious tricks. Schaffen is as intelligent as she is talented, and she is extremely resourceful.]{nl}[That's why I called you here. Giltine thinks you're clever enough not to fall for a trap.]
QUEST_20171128_006995	[What do you mean?]{nl}[Lately that idiot Ziburynas thought he could beat brain with brawn and went after Lydia. Ended up crossed by an arrow. Apparently she even got hold of an essence with his magic in it. That's the rumor we heard from his Pawndel minions; the other lords don't know about it yet. He wasn't even assigned to her, who knows why he went and got himself killed for nothing.]
QUEST_20171128_006996	[I'm sorry to hear that.]{nl}[If she kills you too, we'll have no one left to go to for this.]{nl}[Pardon? I- What is that you mean by...?]{nl}[It's your job now to get the Revelation from Lydia Schaffen. Your mission is in a place the humans call the Star something Lake. She is busy there building some kind of tower.]{nl}Solcomm knew this was not an order he was allowed to refuse, and so he signaled to Gesti his obedience. With that began the history of his legendary defeat.
QUEST_20171128_006997	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 1
QUEST_20171128_006998	If the tower is completed, attacking by force is useless, Solcomm thought.{nl}The cold brawl between him and Schaffenstar was beginning to warm up again. It all started when Solcomm was in the process of gathering his demon henchmen. Mobilizing a large group of demons in the human realm was no easy task, especially when it involved staying under the radar of the goddesses.
QUEST_20171128_006999	Perhaps fortunately for him, many were the demons Lydia Schaffen had encountered and killed throughout her life, including several high-ranked demon lords. This was a convenient pretext for Solcomm's side to launch a revenge war without over-worrying about their agreement with the goddesses.
QUEST_20171128_007000	Whether it was in true combat, or whether Schaffen killed those demons in self-defense did not matter. The truth remained that they needed to move a whole army of demons. To make matters worse, there was always the chance of an extended war with Lydia and her Schaffenstar organization, which would require constant supply of demon soldiers and trusted officials to command them.{nl}Assembling demon subordinates was an arduous task, even for a demon lord. Hauberk was right when he touted over and over again that demons needed better systematization of their orders. No demon should be without association, he had said.
QUEST_20171128_007001	Unfortunately, being thorough was not in their nature. Orders were given by whichever high-rank official was nearest, so subordinates simply fell under the control of whomever they preferred. The Creator had provided them and the goddesses with enough freedom. It simply happened that the idea of systematization did not conform with their principles. More importantly, when the power of every demon was needed, they had Giltine.
QUEST_20171128_007002	For better or for worse, demons of all degrees answered to Giltine, although the situation did not call for her to mobilize the entire demon forces. They still saw systematization as ineffective and cumbersome, despite some, like Hauberk, believing otherwise.{nl}It took Solcomm longer than expected to gather demons for combat and sufficient minions to serve them. When he finally arrived at Starlit Lake, he saw in all its glory the Astral Tower, now fully complete and operational.
QUEST_20171128_007003	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 2
QUEST_20171128_007004	It was the day of his first attack. He sighted a few Shaffenstar members scraping the bottom of the lake with rakes and other instruments, and he gave his subordinates orders to charge.{nl}The first demon hadn't yet reached the side of the lake when they heard the alarm sound inside the Astral Tower. Given its enormous height, it became clear that a surprise attack was all but impossible. Perhaps they would have been more successful on a foggy day, although fog was rarely an occurrence near that lake. It was said to be one of the reasons Lydia Schaffen had chosen it in the first place.
QUEST_20171128_007005	The Shaffenstar members working around the lake had heard the alarm and were preparing to abandon the location. As the lake was only ankle-deep, from far away it looked as if the people were walking on the water. Steady but collected, they hurried back inside the tower.{nl}The alarm had come too fast for the demons to attempt an attack on the returning members. Solcomm did not release any more orders to his men, but as the first demons made contact with the lake, something unexpected happened.
QUEST_20171128_007006	Some demons were instantly scorched, some melted, yet others turned to stone: it was as if the lake was toxic, provoking all kinds of gruesome reactions on their bodies.{nl}Solcomm muttered under his breath. They had no way to know what was in that water until then.{nl}The entire lake could be seen and surveilled from the Astral Tower. There was even a large telescope at the top.
QUEST_20171128_007007	Any recon operation, even in a small team, seemed impossible. Attempting one was accepting the almost sure chance of being discovered. There would be no turning back.
QUEST_20171128_007008	Solcomm dismissed his head officer and gave his subordinates orders to retrieve a sample of lake water before retreating entirely. He had chosen to remain optimistic about his efforts.
QUEST_20171128_007009	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 3
QUEST_20171128_007010	Investigating the lake water was futile. Perhaps they could have found a solution for a simpler kind of holy water, but this substance was much more complex. It had been created with not only magic, but alchemistic and theological knowledge far too advanced to decipher in such a short time.
QUEST_20171128_007011	Observing the sacrifice of the first demons to come in contact with the lake taught them that it was part holy water, modified to react to demons and nothing else. They would have attempted to destroy the main devices powering the water's reaction, but getting to them involved passing through the lake's dangerous waters. Even without the interference of Schaffenstar's members, there was no way around it.
QUEST_20171128_007012	 Solcomm certainly had his talented subordinates, but all Schaffenstar members were expert marksmen. Each demon would have been crossed by ten different arrows before they could even reach the lake's devices. Sure enough, even their most agile flying demons could not escape the tower's large ballista.
QUEST_20171128_007013	 Next, he attempted an attack by ship. Despite its shallow appearance, the Starlit Lake hid in it an abyss of unknown depth. The Astral Tower had been magically built hovering above this abyss, with the path leading to the tower also constructed through magic means. The area containing the tower and its path had been built on floating magic stones, while the rest remained a normal lake. Solcomm's plan, then, was to attack the tower from the magic-free zones surrounding it.
QUEST_20171128_007014	Unfortunately, obtaining the ships he needed wasn't as easy as planned. Even with Pbeta in charge of gathering ships and volunteers to sail them, their numbers fell short, so Solcomm resorted to secretly contacting Premier Eminent for help. Eminent had been gathering tremendous wealth in the human realm and was able to support their endeavour. Thus the demons could finally set sail on the Starlit Lake.
QUEST_20171128_007015	Sailing aboard the ships, the demons avoided contact with the water. They sailed for a few moments without signs of the enemy. The lake did not seem protected by any naval forces. Upon reaching a certain point in the lake, a downpour of arrows suddenly began to fall onto the demons' ships, piercing holes and splashing the lake's harmful water on their bodies. Unable to save the ships, the demons were helpless as water continued to infiltrate through the holes.
QUEST_20171128_007016	The attack was not unforeseen, however. Solcomm had expected the occupants of the tower to fire their arsenal at his men; it was their most obvious means for defense.
QUEST_20171128_007017	Solcomm's goal was to determine whether his enemies on the lake in Astral Tower had other means of defense besides projectile weapons.{nl}After much sacrifice and enduring countless arrows and weapons fired by the Schaffenstar members, he managed to approach the tower. Convinced that he now understood every means of defense at the tower's disposal, Solcomm retreated his army.
QUEST_20171128_007018	Even his flying monsters, which are normally capable of attacking rooftops and flying over the lake, were useless. However, Solcomm's attempt to approach the tower was not in vain.{nl}Now that he was assured that Astral Tower only protected itself with projectile weapons, he came up with a plan.
QUEST_20171128_007019	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 4
QUEST_20171128_007020	The area containing Astral Tower and the lake was later designated as under Schaffenstar's jurisdiction, but the people have been living there before that.{nl}Rather than the immediate area surrounding the tower, where battles could happen at any moment, people lived above the lake, which was fairly distant from the tower.{nl}Some parts of the village were built above magical levitation stones, which were placed by Schaffenstar, and other parts were built above boats and wooden structures.
QUEST_20171128_007021	These people were Solcomm's next target. He was certain that Schaffenstar would never let these people suffer. Based on recent battles, Solcomm figured that most ranged weapons in Astral Tower could not reach the lake village, and even if some magic attack reached the area, its effects would be greatly reduced. 
QUEST_20171128_007022	After some sieges and scouting attempts, Solcomm learned this: Astral Tower is equipped with weapons that can strike down enemy ships. In order to make such defense possible, the lake was carefully divided into areas that have magical levitation stones to allow passage, as well as areas that were empty.{nl}Due to this, attacking the tower with ships was close to suicidal. It didn't matter whether the ships were filled with demons or humans. The ships would be destroyed.
QUEST_20171128_007023	To Solcomm's surprise, no one seemed to know how deep the lake was. If any of the demons were to touch its water, they would melt and burn like acid.{nl}Solcomm previously sent his beast monsters and captured humans to scout underwater, but none returned. Finally, Solcomm decided to dive under the lake himself.
QUEST_20171128_007024	However, even after swimming downward for five hours, he had to return without seeing the lake's bottom.{nl}The further he plunged, he encountered stranger and more aggressive creatures.{nl}When the armor he was wearing was punctured, the lake's water, which was fatal to demons, came pouring in. Solcomm almost died before coming ashore, and he had to give up scouting underwater. 
QUEST_20171128_007025	It is a surprise that fishermen living above the lake paid taxes to Schaffenstar, the governing body of Astral Tower, and received protection in return.{nl}Although it wasn't designated as such by the king yet, Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar were basically the rulers of the lake.{nl}The people living above and around the lake were proud of serving Lydia Schaffen, a legendary hero, and the Schaffenstar members were fair and just in their ruling. Other than some big cities, no place was safer than this lake.
QUEST_20171128_007026	Whenever there were monsters near the area, the Schaffenstar members were immediately deployed to shoot them down.{nl}However, with a large demon army such as Solcomm's, things went a bit differently.{nl}Without full-on battles outside the tower, the area's villagers couldn't be protected.{nl}Also, even if the Schaffenstar members were all elite marksmen, fighting in the open is nothing like firing arrows from an impregnable tower.
QUEST_20171128_007027	Generally speaking, archers need either distance or height to gain a combat advantage. Otherwise, they become easy targets for enemy infantry and cavalry. Solcomm knew that even the famous Schaffenstar wouldn't be able to overcome these limits.
QUEST_20171128_007028	The problem was luring them out. Solcomm's plan was to attack the lake village to force Schaffenstar to come out of their tower.{nl}Right after Solcomm began his attacks, the entrance to the village was shut tight.{nl}Although it wasn't much, it was enough to make it very inconvenient for demons to approach though the lake's fatal water.{nl}However, tearing down its wooden barriers would be a simple task with enough ships.{nl}Solcomm was certain that Schaffenstar would have to come out if that happened.
QUEST_20171128_007029	However, it never happened.{nl}In fact, there was no need.
QUEST_20171128_007030	Tornadoes suddenly appeared.{nl}It was merely a lake, but the tornados' scale was overwhelmingly huge.{nl}Solcomm couldn't help but stare at it.
QUEST_20171128_007031	Although the lake was considerable large, and tornadoes can occur on land, the occurrence itself was quite baffling.{nl}When tornadoes appear precisely above attacking ships, this doesn't happen by chance.{nl}Frankly, these tornadoes were so precise in their positioning, that they kept circling the village.{nl}Whenever these tornadoes barely touched Solcomm's ships, they were overturned, throwing helpless demons into the lake in the process.{nl}Although some ships managed to avoid these tornadoes, the lake's fatal water was sprayed all over the ships.
QUEST_20171128_007032	This didn't happen when the demons were attacking the tower itself.{nl}It could be deduced that Schaffenstar wasn't trying to hide their capability of summoning tornadoes, but rather, built villages in places where tornadoes could be summoned in the first place.{nl}Sadly, for Solcomm, this deduction was correct.{nl}Solcomm had to retreat without getting to see a single arrow, let alone Schaffenstar members.
QUEST_20171128_007033	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 5
QUEST_20171128_007034	His next plan was to hire human mercenaries.{nl}Strategically, it was much better to create an army containing both demons and human mercenaries, but even the greediest mercenaries weren't too keen on fighting alongside demons.{nl}Solcomm even had to disguise himself as a human to get them to sign the contracts in the first place.
QUEST_20171128_007035	Even then, most mercenaries, who were initially interested in offered payment, refused to attack peaceful villagers.{nl}Even the crazier ones who were willing to attack the innocent would look at Solcomm in disbelief after learning that Lydia Schaffen will be their foe.
QUEST_20171128_007036	Furthermore, one of the mercenaries reported to the royal officers of these recruiting efforts, causing government officials to start searching for suspicious people looking to hire mercenaries.{nl}This prevented any mercenaries from joining Solcomm.
QUEST_20171128_007037	To make matters worse, Pbeta, who has been supporting Solcomm by traveling between the demonic world and the human world, reported Solcomm's mistakes to Demon Queen Gesti, causing him to be summoned and scolded. After this incident was spread within the underworld, other demon lords and queens started to look down upon Solcomm, causing his position in the underworld to fall even further.
QUEST_20171128_007038	Although Solcomm gave a warning to Pbeta for her reports, doing so was her job, so he couldn't just blame everything on her.{nl}At least, it was a relief to him that Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar haven't warned others of the attack, let alone ask for reinforcements. However, this was likely due to Schaffenstar's pride and their level of preparation for the attack.
QUEST_20171128_007039	Solcomm did not know this at the time, but Lydia Schaffen didn't ask for help because the tower must be prepared to withstand attacks without any support from the royal army or militia for centuries to come.{nl}She was very much aware that someone like King Kadumel could rise to power at any moment to unite the demons with humans. Kings like Kadumel will undoubtedly try to seize the secrets contained in Astral tower, and the tower must be able to stand tall when that happens.{nl}Sadly, Solcomm was destined to slowly learn this over the next couple of centuries.
QUEST_20171128_007040	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 6
QUEST_20171128_007041	If we were to use force, we should have done it before the tower was complete, was Solcomm's conclusion. Even so, Solcomm had no other choice but to resort to an all-out attack. He couldn't just ignore the criticisms from his superiors, so he had to push on. Also, he had to try at least once.
QUEST_20171128_007042	While being very much aware that Schaffenstar will not lower their defenses, Solcomm kept his force from making hasty attacks, and gathered even more demons by pushing Pbeta.{nl}After Solcomm's failures were spread in the demonic world, Pbeta's job of recruiting demons became much more difficult, and she made sure to let Solcomm know of her difficulties.{nl}However, Solcomm was ready to push himself to  the end for the last time.
QUEST_20171128_007043	For more than six months, Solcomm prepared for his all-out attack. He didn't have enough flying demons, nor enough ships, but he had to make do by approaching the tower through the lake. 
QUEST_20171128_007044	The magical levitation stones were floating in a way that shallow water still flowed over them. It was too shallow for boats, and still too deep for demons to cross.{nl}Lydia Schaffen made sure these stones were floating at the exact heights to make this possible. This also made Schaffenstar members' shoes wet all the time, but for demons, it was a deadly threat.
QUEST_20171128_007045	When there weren't any battles or training during the day, Schaffenstar's recruits removed moss and water plants from the stones with rakes.{nl}After that, they carefully walked to the edge and tossed the plants in the lake.{nl}These tossed plants eventually became food for creatures living in the lake, leading countless creatures to be gathered around the floating stones.
QUEST_20171128_007046	Schaffenstar recruits were strictly trained and taught where the edges were, and where it was safe to walk, because there was no end to the lake's depth.{nl}Their daily routine of removing plants was also helpful in drilling this information into their minds. Of course, seniors were always nearby to make sure absolutely no recruits accidently fell in the lake.
QUEST_20171128_007047	Such accidents were much more fatal than one would think.{nl}As mentioned before, creatures were always gathered around the edges of these stones.{nl}These creatures may seem harmless from above, but if someone were to fall over the edge, they would attack that person without any hesitation. A fall into the lake was almost impossible to survive.{nl}This was one of the biggest reasons that made attacking the tower from the lake very difficult.{nl}If the boats were to sink, the demons didn't have anywhere to swim to.{nl}Although they were strong enough to swim to the edges of these stones, those were the most dangerous places.
QUEST_20171128_007048	The parts of the lake that didn't have any magical levitation stones over them were much safer.{nl}Of course, this would only be true until the demons become exhausted from swimming and sunk below.{nl}However, the villagers under protection of Schaffenstar were mostly safe in these areas. You see, the plants that were fed to them weren't intended to be food, but rather, highly addictive substances.{nl}This was one of Lydia's defensive strategies.
QUEST_20171128_007049	Because of their addiction, most of the aggressive and carnivorous creatures stayed around these edges, and other fish could safely breed and grow their numbers. This hugely benefited the fishermen of the village.{nl}Although carnivorous creatures would sometimes return to the lake's center to find their prey, they would immediately return to the edges for more plants afterward.{nl}The fishermen ran into these creatures occasionally, but they always carried some dried water plants to toss in the water.
QUEST_20171128_007050	However, tossing these plants in the wrong places could lead to fatal accidents, so the Schaffenstar members warned the fishermen to do this only when necessary.{nl}In the end, since most of these plants were tossed near the edges, the most dangerous creatures just stayed there rather than chasing the fishermen.
QUEST_20171128_007051	All of these factors guaranteed that the walkable surfaces were kept clean.{nl}These clean surfaces were soon tainted by Solcomm and his minions during their march toward the Astral Tower.
QUEST_20171128_007052	They brought vast amounts of soil to pour over the stones, which made it safe for the demons to march.{nl}It is a textbook tactic to fill moats that surround castles, but in this case, the whole lake functioned as one giant moat. A siege that involved filling a whole lake like this was unprecedented.{nl}Thankfully for the demons, the water was shallow enough where they were, but they still had a long way to go.{nl}Also, they had to cover a wide surface to avoid incoming arrows from the tower.
QUEST_20171128_007053	Despite their fierce march, a whole day has passed without a single battle.{nl}This was peculiar, but expected at the same time. The demons were busy filling the lake to make paths, and they kept out of Astral Tower's catapult's reach.{nl}Even Lydia Schaffen was limited by her weapons' range.
QUEST_20171128_007054	Because the area above the magical levitation stones were actually safe from the Astral Tower's defensive weapons,{nl}all Schaffenstar had to do was place guards on the tower and observe their slow progress. The typical process of pouring arrows upon attackers' siege attempts wasn't going to happen for a while.
QUEST_20171128_007055	On the second day, it finally happened.{nl}Solcomm's army finally reached the tower's attack range.{nl}Right after this, Schaffenstar members fired all sorts of projectiles above demons' heads, which reached much further than what humans' weapons are normally capable of. While the projectiles were flying over them, the demons had no choice but to keep filling the lake.
QUEST_20171128_007056	Siege towers with roofs were brought to minimize the damage, but even such structures would fall to the continuous stream of projectiles.{nl}One positive outcome from all this was that the thrown rocks could be utilized to fill more parts of the lake.{nl}Because the Astral Tower was built on top of a lake, most traditional siege weapons were rendered useless.{nl}For example, digging tools for sieges couldn't be used, even if demons were capable of digging underwater.
QUEST_20171128_007057	Solcomm was indeed aware of the fact that Lydia Schaffen would be fully prepared for him.{nl}If his enemy was the lake, he was even prepared to bring an army the size of an ocean to swallow that lake. He was under that much pressure from by his superiors.
QUEST_20171128_007058	Unfortunately, for Solcomm, his army was progressing at an excruciatingly slow speed, and its number was becoming smaller by the minute.{nl}Most demons and monsters love to fight, and are used to desperate situations.{nl}However, this was something else. All they did was staring at their feet while being attacked. Unsurprisingly, complaints began pouring out.{nl}Dying in a proper battle was much more preferable, and they are much more controllable during battles.
QUEST_20171128_007059	However, Solcomm's minions quickly grew tired doing nothing against the arrows and stones that were flying toward them.{nl}Even Pbeta's discontent toward Solcomm was growing.
QUEST_20171128_007060	Despite all this, his army finally reached the tower's entrance.{nl}Flying demons, who were occupied in shooting down the projectiles, could finally focus on attacking the tower.{nl}Although some demons had to keep filling the lake, the rest could march straight over the small amount of water. Finally, after several days have passed, they would have their proper battle.
QUEST_20171128_007061	 Of course, streams of boiling water, stones, arrows, fire, and magic started pouring over the demons' heads when they got close enough. Most of the flying demons were hit by arrows soon after the battle began, and they fell on parts of the lake that weren't filled.{nl}Although it seemed like Solcomm was fighting a losing battle, it was still a battle.
QUEST_20171128_007062	Solcomm was ready to fight to his death, no matter the outcome. All of his demons were already on the lake, and Solcomm himself charged in front of his minions.{nl}Despite popular belief, there is no such thing as an impregnable castle.{nl}Even if all the siege attempts had failed, the defenders are bound to run out of resources without help from allies to attack the surrounding army. Sturdy weaponry and catapults are only there to buy enough time for that to happen. Whether you were on the attacking side, or the defending side, the side who is able to hold out wins.
QUEST_20171128_007063	Knowing this, Solcomm kept encouraging his demons.{nl}But then, when he looked over his head, he saw Lydia Schaffen herself, aiming an arrow at his head.{nl}It almost looked as if she was waiting for Solcomm to see her aiming at him.
QUEST_20171128_007064	At that moment, Solcomm immediately recognized the weapon she was holding. It was the bow that killed the Demon Lord Ziburynas.{nl}A single arrow would be enough to kill Solcomm.{nl}Solcomm was well aware that she would be able to hit him with her arrow if he charged in front.{nl}Despite this, he had to do this to silence the resentment from his minions and superiors.
QUEST_20171128_007065	He could withstand the scolding from Gesti, but if she sent him back to Kartas, there would be no telling what he would do to Solcomm as punishment.{nl}Being tortured by Kartas was much worse than being killed by Lydia's arrows.
QUEST_20171128_007066	However, her arrow never came. Instead, she withdrew her arrow and said this: [Fools! You are standing over stones that are controlled with magic.]{nl}Her words could be clearly heard by Solcomm who was still quite far away.{nl}However, he did not understand the meaning behind her words. He was about to find out.
QUEST_20171128_007067	At that moment, the stones that Solcomm's army was standing on started trembling, and soon after, they started to sink below the lake.{nl}Even demons who generally remain calm in times of chaos started screaming.{nl}Water started pouring over the stones and burned every demon that was on them.{nl}Solcomm couldn't do anything but watch his minions burn and melt in water.{nl}It was then Solcomm finally realized that Lydia was waiting for his entire army to move on to the lake.{nl}The distance his army had to run would take days.{nl}Even his flying minions had to avoid rains of arrows to retreat.
QUEST_20171128_007068	When only a handful of demons made it out, Pbeta arrived with additional demons from the demonic world.{nl}Because Solcomm was too shocked to do anything, Pbeta calmed the survivors in his stead.
QUEST_20171128_007069	Based on the report made by Pbeta after this incident, these magical levitation stones cannot be raised or lowered easily.{nl}According to experts on magic, if the stones were moved like this once, it would take decades before being able to do so again.
QUEST_20171128_007070	However, at the very moment, Solcomm and Pbeta didn't have the time to think it through. All the construction done over the stones were destroyed,{nl}and Schaffenstar members took back what could be used as defensive weapons, and threw out the rest.
QUEST_20171128_007071	Some demons were sent to interrupt their operations, but it was too difficult to fight on the lake in the first place. Also, the guards on the tower quickly warned the cleaning crew whenever any demons got close. Half of Schaffenstar shot arrows to keep them at bay, and the other half would run to retreat, taking turns.{nl}The situation was against Solcomm from the beginning, but it didn't stop him from being shunned by demon society.{nl}Although the lower demons wouldn't dare insult him at his face, Solcomm was aware of their discontent.{nl}He couldn't, however, figure out how to regain their trust.
QUEST_20171128_007072	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 7
QUEST_20171128_007073	In the end, the demons failed in surrounding the tower and making humans inside to starve to death.{nl}Lydia Schaffen didn't even have to ask for help. After people found out that she was being attacked by the demons, countless men and women took up arms and went to the lake. Even the Royal Army was deployed due to public demand.
QUEST_20171128_007074	Since Solcomm didn't want to fight to the death, he retreated his demons and minions, and went into hiding.{nl}After this incident, it became clear that large-scale sieges like this won't be viable unless the humans' unity was broken and their kingdom fell into chaos.{nl}This surely wasn't going to happen anytime soon, and Solcomm wasn't in a hurry.{nl}Although Pbeta kept trying, assembling demons for attacks was becoming more difficult with each passing day.
QUEST_20171128_007075	Then, Solcomm decided to use humans' one weakness: their mortality.{nl}He decided to simply wait for Lydia Schaffen to grow old and die.{nl}Solcomm was looked down upon by his minions due to this so-called plan, but he was running out of options.{nl}However, he also worked behind the scenes to prevent anyone from becoming Lydia Schaffen's successor or joining Shaffenstar.
QUEST_20171128_007076	Sadly, his schemes and tricks were all in vain.{nl}Schaffen's legacies and stories were heard all around the kingdom.{nl}The story of her being in disguise and punishing a tyrannical lord by hitting an apple on the head of a farmer's son,{nl}her forest adventures with Jon Himil (who was curiously considered small, despite his huge size) and their group of righteous outlaws during their days as members of Shaffenstar, the tale of her outsmarting Rumpelstiltskin in a bet, and the legend of her killing the demon king Ziburynas spread far and wide. After hearing of her exploits, countless people came to Shaffenstar to join them.
QUEST_20171128_007077	However, with enough patience, the chance to infiltrate the tower could come. Even if it would take centuries.{nl}Solcomm had the necessary patience, and was aware of humans' nature of forgetting their initial stance over time.{nl}What he didn't know, was that his minions weren't as patient as him.

QUEST_20180122_007157	So I was wondering what to do about this monster.{nl}I noticed a few other monsters with this golden dust falling off of them: some Red Spions and Firents in Salvia Forest and Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20180122_007158	{nl}My suspicious colleague gave all my bullet recipes to Manager Rota, so she's the one who has them now.
QUEST_20180122_007159	You'll have to get the recipes from Manager Rota and make them yourself.
QUEST_20180122_007160	You'll need a material called Demon Magic Dust for all the bullets.{nl}There are 5 magic aggregators installed at the Shaton Reservoir giving out a reddish light.
QUEST_20180122_007161	Get rid of some monsters around it and get their flesh.
QUEST_20180122_007162	When the magic aggregator's light is on, add in the flesh and it will come out as Demon Magic Dust.
QUEST_20180122_007163	For the Frost bullets you'll need Pure Frost Fragments, which you can get from Ice property monsters.{nl}They usually live in Vedas Plateau, so head there.
QUEST_20180122_007164	For the Lightning Bullets you need Electric Stones.{nl}They're impossible to spot with the naked eye, though.
QUEST_20180122_007165	I made you a lantern you can use to find the Electric Stones.{nl}Turn on the lantern and walk around until you see the Electric Stones shine.
QUEST_20180122_007166	Once you made all the bullets, shoot the Frost Bullets at the Red Spions in Salvia Forest and the Fire Bullets at the Firents in Nefritas Cliff.
QUEST_20180122_007167	As for the Lightning Bullets, they're for the Blue Lepusbunny monsters in Sekta Forest.
QUEST_20180122_007168	They have a strange glow going on under their feet, so you'll know when you see them.
QUEST_20180122_007169	I'm writing it all down in case you forget.{nl}Just make sure to get the bullet recipes from Manager Rota.
QUEST_20180122_007170	Remember the lantern I gave you?{nl}Turn it on and the Electric Stones will shine when you're near.
QUEST_20180122_007171	This device can no longer produce Demon Magic Dust.
QUEST_20180122_007172	That's enough Cockatrice Leather.
QUEST_20180122_007173	Oh, I almost forgot. You aren't familiar with shadows yet; it can be difficult for you to see them.{nl}If you look at my research devices, you'll see a blue light shine around them. That's when you should use them.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007174	The energy of the devices makes shadows appear more clearly around you.{nl}You can turn off that effect at the device if you want it to return to normal.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007175	If you do turn it off, however, you'll have to wait until the devices glow again to reactivate the effect.{nl}If you have any questions about the characteristics of the shadows in each region, do ask. I will do my best to answer.
QUEST_20180122_007176	The device of Lhadar Forest is at the hill between Tjibes Refuge and Bethez Refuge.{nl}The shadows there appear much more clearly than those in other regions according to their influence.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007177	If you see a shadow, try and approach only shadows of the same influence.{nl}Increase that influence in the shadows to obtain their traces.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007178	You need to be careful, however. If you catch a shadow carrying another kind of influence, you own influence will decrease.{nl}Keep that in mind.
QUEST_20180122_007179	If you leave, you will have to wait until a shadow's influence manifests itself in the device again.{nl}Are you sure you want to leave?
QUEST_20180122_007180	Information
QUEST_20180122_007181	The shadows of Khonot Forest will run away if you approach them, so you need to become a shadow yourself.{nl}Press the Space key on the transformation device to turn into a shadow.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007182	After some time you will return to your original appearance.{nl}Once transformed into a shadow, quickly approach other shadows and press the Space key to catch them and increase your influence.
QUEST_20180122_007183	Choose one of the three influences of Lhadar Forest shadows and attack.{nl}After you attack and increase your own influence, make sure to only go after shadows of that same influence.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007184	Keep in mind that attacking shadows of a different influence will reduce your own.
QUEST_20180122_007185	Approach the shadows of Ziburynas Forest and press the Space key to scare them, increasing your influence.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007186	Some shadows may be hidden and waiting to scare you.{nl}If you fall victim to their pranks, your own influence decreases.
QUEST_20180122_007187	Catch the shadows at the Namu Temple Ruins to increase your influence.{nl}
QUEST_20180122_007188	Some shadows might try and chase you instead.{nl}Your influence decreases if you are caught by them, so be careful.

QUEST_20180208_007238	I need some Cockatrice Leather, Beetow Feelers and Minivern Skin in good condition.{nl}The problem is, since these are monster materials, they're not sold on the market.
QUEST_20180208_007239	LOST: Missing important amulets belonging to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}If found, please return to General Lamin for reward.
QUEST_20180208_007240	The guard ought to know about the missing amulet.
QUEST_20180208_007241	You do seem like an experienced adventurer, but it's a very dangerous situation, you see.
QUEST_20180208_007242	Alright, I can see you're determined to help.{nl}I worry if this isn't too much of a burden for you, but I can at least tell you where the amulet is.{nl}The amulet is with someone named Eimantas.
QUEST_20180208_007243	He had a problem he wanted to solve, so he went to visit the Exorcist Master.
QUEST_20180208_007244	No has heard from him after Poslinkis Forest, however.{nl}There's a chance he might still be there.
QUEST_20180208_007245	The amulet is a kind of necklace, and it is very dear to the Nak Muay Master.{nl}One time, the Master had to borrow money at the arena to support his family, and he gave the amulet as security.
QUEST_20180208_007246	Unfortunately, the manager that lent him the money ended up selling away the amulet.
QUEST_20180208_007247	Since the amulet is a necklace, an accessory merchant might know something more about it.
QUEST_20180208_007248	An amulet? Do you mean the necklace with the three men engraved in it?{nl}Yes, there are a lot of rumors about that necklace.
QUEST_20180208_007249	They say that a ghost will haunt you if you wear it, and that it curses you with horrible nightmares.{nl}I'm not sure, either.
QUEST_20180208_007250	But if you need more information, I'm sure the Wings of Vaivora can help you.
QUEST_20180208_007251	The amulet with the ghost?{nl}Yes, that necklace looks very different from the usual. It naturally attracts people's curiosity.
QUEST_20180208_007252	Although it seems that the ghost that lives in the amulet is closely related to its original owner.{nl}So when the amulet falls in the hands of another person, the ghost will appear in their dreams and demand that they return the amulet.
QUEST_20180208_007253	We don't know who the original owner is, however.{nl}All we know is that, the longer the amulet is away...{nl}... the more it becomes corrupted by the ghost's fears and sorrows. It even attracted an evil spirit.
QUEST_20180208_007254	And now there is no way to reach the amulet's ghost without first giving the evil spirit what it wants.{nl}To make matters worse, the current owner of the amulet suffers from nightmares so horrible it's become nearly impossible to talk to them.
QUEST_20180208_007255	The way I see it, only an Exorcist or someone equally blessed with the grace of the goddesses could solve this.
QUEST_20180208_007256	We remember our friend, who so fond was of strawberry cupcakes. We hope you are eating them with the goddesses now...
QUEST_20180208_007257	To my beloved wife Isala, who passed without ever seeing our daughter Asana grow. May you find happiness by the goddesses...
QUEST_20180208_007258	Our dear friend; your disease can no longer hurt you where you are. May you find eternal peace by the goddesses...
QUEST_20180208_007259	My friend. How you longed to return to the Inner Enceinte District, your home destroyed by the curse.{nl}May your new home by the goddesses offer you the comfort you yearned for.
QUEST_20180208_007260	To my friend, who died before he could profess his love... (The stone is destroyed, making it impossible to read the rest.)
QUEST_20180208_007261	There's an altar to make offerings.
QUEST_20180208_007262	You want to know if I can make a strawberry cupcake for a spirit? Of course I can.
QUEST_20180208_007263	I'm going to need strawberries and flour and all those things, but if it's for a spirit I also need Red Meduja Essence.{nl}{nl}I already have everything except for the strawberries and Meduja essence.{nl}
QUEST_20180208_007264	If you bring me about 100 Strawberries and 130 Red Meduja Essences I can make you the best strawberry cupcake for your offering.
QUEST_20180208_007265	Oh, you have all the ingredients.{nl}Alright, just wait now.
QUEST_20180208_007266	I'll make the biscuits in no time.

QUEST_20180208_007269	Well, it's not impossible.{nl}If I have all the ingredients, that is.{nl}I'll need about 1 Holy Water, 1 Antidote and 100 Bright Ellom Bells.
QUEST_20180208_007270	You have all the materials, good.{nl}I'll get it done right away, just wait a while.
QUEST_20180208_007271	Here you go.
QUEST_20180208_007272	A house for homesick spirits, you say?{nl}Hm... I can't make them a house, but there is a way to comfort them.
QUEST_20180208_007273	I could carve a little wooden house, and if you bring me a rock or something from their hometown, I can add that to the sculpture.{nl}I'll get started on the house; you can go and find that.
QUEST_20180208_007274	Oh, a dandelion from the spirit's hometown.{nl}Alright, just wait a while.
QUEST_20180208_007275	I'll get right to it.
QUEST_20180208_007276	There you go.{nl}I hope it can bring some comfort to the spirits who lost their homes.
QUEST_20180208_007277	Oh, yes, the girl who looks after her sick father.{nl}She used to live in Fedimian, but they've moved to Tenants' Farm now.{nl}It seems she thought the country life would be better for her father's health.
QUEST_20180208_007278	Hm... I'm not sure who you mean.
QUEST_20180208_007279	Yeah, I know Asana.{nl}She was well-known in Fedimian. Beautiful inside and out.
QUEST_20180208_007280	I heard she moved to Tenants' Farm with her dad. Wonder what she's been up to now.

QUEST_20180208_007282	Yes, the girl who moved to Tenants' Farm with her ailing father.{nl}I'm afraid there isn't much I can tell you about her.
QUEST_20180208_007283	Asana?{nl}I can't be sure.{nl}You might want to ask someone else.
QUEST_20180208_007284	Asana. Wasn't that the girl who lived with her dad in Fedimian?{nl}I heard she took the father to Tenants' Farm because of his health, but I don't know what happened to them after that.
QUEST_20180208_007285	Asana...{nl}Huh, I can't remember.
QUEST_20180208_007286	Sorry I can't help.
QUEST_20180208_007287	You mean you don't know the girl who works to support her poor father?{nl}They went away to Tenants' Farm, but I don't know how they're doing over there.
QUEST_20180208_007288	Sorry, I'm getting old. My memory isn't what it used to be.
QUEST_20180208_007289	Asana...{nl}Haven't heard that name in a long time.
QUEST_20180208_007290	She always worked so hard to support her father. Kind girl, she was.{nl}She moved to Tenants' Farm with him. Thought the countryside would be better for his health.
QUEST_20180208_007291	I wonder if they're doing alright in Tenants' Farm.
QUEST_20180208_007292	Asana?{nl}I'm not sure.
QUEST_20180208_007293	Asana? The girl who went to Tenants' Farm with her sick father?{nl}I don't know that much about her.
QUEST_20180208_007294	I'm not sure who that is.{nl}You ought to ask someone else.

QUEST_20180208_007296	I don't know. Sorry, I don't really see many people around here.
QUEST_20180208_007297	Asana?{nl}Yes, she recently moved to Tenants' Farm with her father because of his health.{nl}I heard there was trouble at the farm; hopefully they are okay.
QUEST_20180208_007298	Yes, the girl who works to support her father.{nl}I wonder how she's doing.
QUEST_20180208_007299	Asana no longer lives here. They went to Tenants' Farm, for her father's health.

QUEST_20180208_007315	I started having nightmares after I bought this necklace with three martial artists engraved in it.{nl}I couldn't take them anymore, so I went to see an exorcist.
QUEST_20180208_007316	The exorcist told me my case was too particular, that it was dangerous to try anything.{nl}I just know that the only way for me to break free from this agony is to do what the spirits of the amulet want.
QUEST_20180208_007317	Unfortunately, even if I want to listen to the spirits, I don't know what to do. And then there's the problem with the evil spirits in the amulet.{nl}I tried all I could to get rid of this torment but nothing works. My nightmares are only getting longer.

QUEST_20180208_007348	It didn't use to feel like this. Before, if I just walked towards the light, I could still free myself from the nightmare.{nl}But now... I don't see that light anymore.
QUEST_20180208_007349	A spirit in Poslinkis Forest wants to see my little Asana?{nl}It looks like Isala is still not resting in peace.

QUEST_20180320_007866	I believe Elder Ramunas said Pbeta was only carrying part of Ziburynas' essence.{nl}That it was weaker than Ziburynas' energy.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007867	Even so... I'm glad at least part of it is gone now.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007868	Now all we have to do is take back the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007869	I believe you said you also have your own mission to tend to at the Tower...{nl}In that case, we'll head out to the Tower first and investigate.
QUEST_20180320_007870	Resistance Soldier Mait
QUEST_20180320_007871	Hey, I've never seen you before...{nl}Identify yourself.
QUEST_20180320_007872	A Revelator... I'm sorry if I was rude.{nl}Here in front is the temporary residence where the resistance soldiers live.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007873	No unidentified persons are allowed beyond this point.{nl}And I'm afraid I haven't confirmed your identity yet.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007874	Follow me. I need to report to my superiors first.
QUEST_20180320_007875	You can talk to Adjutant Bern.{nl}They'll be waiting for you.
QUEST_20180320_007876	Please to meet you. My name's Adjutant Bern.{nl}May I ask why you're here?
QUEST_20180320_007877	Going to the Astral Tower, you say?{nl}Hmm... I'm afraid it's not as easy as that.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007878	As you can see, the areas surrounding the Tower are infested with demons and monsters.{nl}It's been like this ever since Ignas took command of the Astral Tower...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007879	The demons are all over, but Ignas just seems to be ignoring the problem.{nl}Absolutely nothing is being done about it. It's an outrage!{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007880	In the end, we couldn't support Ignas' lack of action anymore so we formed our own resistance force outside the Tower.{nl}And now, most members who abandon the Tower suspect Ignas may have assassinated the former head of the organization.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007881	I know we've only just met, and I'm so sorry to ask you this...{nl}But would you help us get back the Astral Tower?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007882	If you do, we can help you get you to the inside of the Tower with no problems.
QUEST_20180320_007883	There are many soldiers out there in need of help.{nl}Please tend to them as much as you can.
QUEST_20180320_007884	We're slightly short-handed, so we're always busy, you see.
QUEST_20180320_007885	I see you handled all the urgent issues.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007886	Oh, and our Deputy Commander is looking for you.
QUEST_20180320_007887	Welcome. My name is Kron.{nl}I heard about how you've been helping our soldiers.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007888	I would like to ask you for a special favor.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007889	This lake has a network of Water Facilities installed across different points in the area.{nl}Originally, these facilities kept the demons away by imbuing the lake with properties similar to those of holy water.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007890	Then, the facilities were destroyed by the demons...{nl}And now they have completely invaded the lake.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007891	Fortunately we were able to protect one Water Facility in this district...{nl}But the water point isn't functioning the way it should.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007892	The person responsible for gathering the resistance forces was Elder Ramunas.{nl}He was an advisor at the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007893	I believe he remembers looking at some documents related to the Water Facilities.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007894	After talking to him, I gave orders to one of my subordinates to infiltrate the Astral Tower.{nl}The plan was to recover those Water Facility documents...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007895	They should have reported back by now, but there are no signs of them.{nl}Would you find out what happened to them?
QUEST_20180320_007896	We need the documents if we're ever going to turn this situation around.{nl}I suggest you start with 86 Waters.
QUEST_20180320_007897	I can only hope they got the documents out...
QUEST_20180320_007898	Yes! These are the Water Facility Management documents!{nl}But where is my subordinate?
QUEST_20180320_007899	I see...{nl}It wasn't my intention to cause the death of one of our own...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007900	However... on the memo it says the demons are running wild inside the Astral Tower.{nl}It seems Ignas was siding with them all along.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007901	There's no doubt now that Ignas is colluding with the demons.{nl}Destroying the lake's Water Facilities was probably his idea.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007902	After having a look at the documents, it looks like they contain all the instructions on how to reactivate the water points.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007903	Only... the pages on how to create the protection circles have been ripped off.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007904	We need Magic Stones to reactivate the water points.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007905	There used to be a Magic Stone storage opposite the Water Facility...{nl}But that too was destroyed by the demons.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007906	Would you go there and check whether there are any Magic Stones left?
QUEST_20180320_007907	The old storage was located opposite the Water Facility.{nl}Hopefully there will still be some Magic Stones left there.
QUEST_20180320_007908	Did you find any Magic Stones?
QUEST_20180320_007909	This should be enough.
QUEST_20180320_007910	To restart the water points, we need to place the right amount of Stones in each controller, and in the correct order.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007911	The documents say we need to place 3, 2 and 1 Magic Stones in each controller, in the order of closest to furthest from the water point.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007912	I think the demons might notice if I start moving around...{nl}Would you try and reactivate the water points yourself?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007913	We'll be counting on you.
QUEST_20180320_007914	You need to place the Magic Stones on the controllers in the correct order.{nl}Make sure to check the number of required Magic Stones as well.
QUEST_20180320_007915	I followed you here just to make sure...{nl}That was close!
QUEST_20180320_007916	If you can get the water points working again, the demons won't be able to come near the lake anymore.{nl}You should go on and reactivate the facilities!
QUEST_20180320_007917	Like the Deputy Commander said...{nl}You need to add the Magic Stones in the correct order and number on the controllers for it to work.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007918	If I remember correctly, the order was from closest to furthest from the water point.{nl}Each controller needs 3, 2, and 1 Magic Stones to reactivate.
QUEST_20180320_007919	Think carefully about the right order and number of Magic Stones!
QUEST_20180320_007920	Did you use all the Magic Stones?
QUEST_20180320_007921	Go and check whether the water points are reacting!
QUEST_20180320_007922	The protective magic circles are working!{nl}I'll go and report back to Deputy Commander Kron right away!
QUEST_20180320_007923	Do you have something to say?
QUEST_20180320_007924	A large monster seems to have appeared nearby.
QUEST_20180320_007925	I have something to ask you.{nl}If you can, would you gather some purified water near the water point?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007926	I can't tell whether it's a regular monster or a demon...{nl}But if it is a demon, the purified water will help defeat it.
QUEST_20180320_007927	You can place the water inside this bottle.
QUEST_20180320_007928	If the monster really is a demon, it will react to the purified water from the water point.
QUEST_20180320_007929	You got the purified water.
QUEST_20180320_007930	The Deputy Commander is heading to the location of the monster.{nl}He must have been worried for the soldiers stationed there.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007931	We should head out as well.
QUEST_20180320_007932	The monster is at the top of the Barynwell Watchtower.{nl}We should hurry.
QUEST_20180320_007933	Aren't you coming?{nl}We need to hurry!
QUEST_20180320_007934	Did you defeat the Hydra?
QUEST_20180320_007935	So the purified water was effective.{nl}Even so... what you did was remarkable. Not many people can defeat a Hydra all by themselves.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007936	The water that flows from the water points only reacts to demons.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007937	That means they must have done something to that Hydra.{nl}For now, let's return to the residence.
QUEST_20180320_007938	It's faster to go through 86 Waters.{nl}That's where our soldiers are facing Ignas' forces.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007939	I already told the soldiers there about you, so you should be able to go through with no problems.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007940	Oh, and if you do go through 86 Waters, Elder Ramunas will be at the assembly area.{nl}Please deliver these documents to him.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007941	They need the documents to reactivate their own Water Facility.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007942	Alright, take care.{nl}Thank you for all your help.
QUEST_20180320_007943	The moss growing around the lake makes it difficult for us soldiers to move around.{nl}The ground is too slippery, some of us even got hurt because of it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007944	But the moss is too much for me to remove it all by myself...{nl}Would you give me a hand?
QUEST_20180320_007945	Unfortunately there's no way to do it other than getting it out by hand.{nl}My job used to be clearing out the weeds, so I'm used to it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007946	We always have to be careful around the lake because the moss is so slippery.
QUEST_20180320_007947	You got most of it. Nice.{nl}I'll finish the rest. Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_007948	Resistance Soldier Molan
QUEST_20180320_007949	Did you see all the demons walking around?{nl}The soldiers are having a hard time because of them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007950	We're a little short-handed so I wouldn't dare to take care of them on my own.{nl}I know it's a difficult request, but would you give me a hand?
QUEST_20180320_007951	I wish I could go, but I'm the only soldier guarding this area...{nl}Be careful, then.
QUEST_20180320_007952	The demons took over when the water points stopped functioning...{nl}Hopefully they'll start working again soon...
QUEST_20180320_007953	I already see a lot fewer demons around!{nl}You're amazing.
QUEST_20180320_007954	It's been a long time since the demons invaded the lake.{nl}I'm worried that they'll contaminate the water.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007955	I want to make sure the water isn't contaminated, but it's hard for me to move away...{nl}Would you go out and catch some fish from the lake for me?
QUEST_20180320_007956	Here's a net.{nl}If you can, collect a few lake fish near the Mazas Reservoir.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007957	Oh, but make sure you look into the sections with fewer people.{nl}The lake fish like to gather in remote areas.
QUEST_20180320_007958	People around here drink purified water from the lake. If it gets contaminated...{nl}There's no telling what kind of side effects it could have.
QUEST_20180320_007959	This will be enough. Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_007960	Near the bottom of the Barynwell Watchtower grows a type of weed called Rias.{nl}It's harmless to us, but strangely it seems to keep the demons away.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007961	I'm not sure if it actually repels them, but just to be sure I would like to find some.{nl}Would you collect some Rias Weeds for me?
QUEST_20180320_007962	Thank you.{nl}I need to keep an eye on our barracks, but I'll be counting on you.
QUEST_20180320_007963	There are Rias Weeds growing at the bottom of the Barynwell Watchtower.{nl}Look closely.
QUEST_20180320_007964	You brought a bunch!{nl}Let me see them.
QUEST_20180320_007965	They look like just normal grass.{nl}But they grow with the water from the lake...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007966	Oh! I have an idea. Would you help me?
QUEST_20180320_007967	I'm thinking of a powder made from ground Rias Weeds.{nl}We should see if it has any effect on the demons.
QUEST_20180320_007968	If my guess is right, a Rias Weed powder could be really useful to us.
QUEST_20180320_007969	A-ha! Now I see why the demons never went near the Rias Weeds.{nl}They grow with the water from the lake.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007970	Or they did, until the Water Facilities broke down...{nl}It looks like the purified water from the water point influences the Rias Weeds that grow there.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007971	I need to make more of that powder and share it with the other soldiers.{nl}Thanks!
QUEST_20180320_007972	The first person to gather the resistance forces was Elder Ramunas.{nl}Some people also suspected Ignas was behind the assassination of the previous head of the Astral Tower...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007973	In the end, the main reason was Ignas' lack of competence as head of the Tower.{nl}The lake was being filled up with demons and he did nothing to stop them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007974	Until this day, Ignas isn't doing anything about the demons.{nl}We're the ones fighting against them all over the region...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007975	But we don't have enough means to face both Ignas' forces and the demons.
QUEST_20180320_007976	There are several Water Facilities installed all around the Starlit Lake.{nl}They were made to prevent demons from invading the region.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007977	The water points are used to infuse the lake with something similar to holy water.{nl}The Water Facilities are operated by magic, so they are all managed separately from inside the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007978	Then, little by little, after Medzio Diena the demons started to invade the lake.{nl}Ignas didn't make much of it. He said nothing was going to happen.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007979	I, too, trusted Ignas and thought the lake would be okay, but...{nl}In the end, the demons got ahold of the Water Facilities and destroyed them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007980	Those of us who felt like the problem was serious told Ignas that we should fight the demons and take back the Facilities...{nl}But he continued to act like everything was fine.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007981	Outraged with Ignas' attitude, a group of members abandoned the Tower altogether, led by our Elder Ramunas.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007982	We hurried to check on the Water Facilities as soon as we were out...{nl}But most of them had already been destroyed.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007983	Luckily there was one Facility still remaining, and that was 86 Waters...{nl}Although we're still struggling to drive away the demons, since we can't restart the water point.
QUEST_20180320_007984	Resistance Soldier Rett
QUEST_20180320_007985	Who are you?{nl}This area is extremely dangerous. Go back now.
QUEST_20180320_007986	Oh! You're the Revelator.{nl}I heard about the work you did in 85 Waters.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007987	Elder Ramunas is looking for you. He is in the assembly area.
QUEST_20180320_007988	Elder Ramunas
QUEST_20180320_007989	So you're the Revelator Kron told me about?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007990	And these are the Water Facility Management documents.{nl}Very well. We should get our own Water Facility working soon with these.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007991	Oh. My name is Ramunas, by the way.{nl}I heard all about what you did back in 85 Waters.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007992	Getting the Water Facility working, defeating the Hydra...{nl}It can't have been easy. You're quite impressive.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007993	But, um... I'm afraid the commander in chief isn't here right now.{nl}They left only a minute ago, so it's going to be a while until they're back...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007994	While we wait, would you do me a favor?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007995	Our resistance forces are being outnumbered.{nl}And Ignas' side is filled with talented fighters, so there's little we can do to stop them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_007996	I was hoping you could help Taylor over there launch an attack on their rearguard.{nl}I know it's a lot to ask... but we really need your help.
QUEST_20180320_007997	Elder Ramunas is at the assembly area.
QUEST_20180320_007998	Nice to meet you. My name's Taylor.
QUEST_20180320_007999	Elder Ramunas said that?{nl}Hmm... alright.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008000	We're a little short-handed anyway, we could use the help.{nl}But first, I want to ask you something.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008001	We think Ignas' side set up traps at the assembly area without us noticing.{nl}One of our soldiers hurt his leg because of it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008002	Would you help dismantle and remove the traps?
QUEST_20180320_008003	This the tool we use.{nl}I wish I could go with you, but I need to go check on our supplies.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008004	Oh, after you get all the traps, you can go see our Adjutant Lehon.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008005	Lehon is out now doing recon for our next operation...{nl}But he's the one who developed this tool, if you show it to him he'll know what it is.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008006	If you meet Lehon, help him prepare for the operation.
QUEST_20180320_008007	We're counting on you to get all the traps.{nl}It'll help us move around better.
QUEST_20180320_008008	Are you from the resistance?{nl}That tool you have... I recognize it.
QUEST_20180320_008009	A request from the elder, you say...{nl}Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. My name is Lehon.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008010	Sorry if I suspected you.{nl}I'm a little on edge after going on that recon operation to Ignas' camp.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008011	I was just preparing for the rearguard attack and...{nl}It seems the rearguard on their side are mostly neutral members.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008012	If there was a way I could bring them over to our side...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008013	Would you help us convince them? I'll tell you exactly what to say.{nl}I really think we can make at least some of them cross over.
QUEST_20180320_008014	They already know what I look like, but I think we can disguise you as a member of the Schaffenstar.{nl}You should be okay as long as you don't make a fuss.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008015	Here's what you can say; listen carefully.
QUEST_20180320_008016	Did you finish talking to the members on the other side?
QUEST_20180320_008017	It looks like your work is done.{nl}Very well, let's carry on with the operation.
QUEST_20180320_008018	The rearguard on Ignas' camp has its fair share of supplies stocked up, I'm sure you saw them too.{nl}What I want you to do is spray this poison over their supplies.
QUEST_20180320_008019	The venom is inside this bottle.{nl}I'll be watching from down here.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008020	Make sure no one is around when you do it. You don't want the others suspecting you.
QUEST_20180320_008021	Did you spray the poison on the supplies?{nl}It won't kill them, but it'll stop them for a while. 
QUEST_20180320_008022	That was great!{nl}Little by little the supplies should begin to poison them. Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008023	There's dark smoke coming out of the assembly area.{nl}Something must have happened...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008024	Would you check the area for me?
QUEST_20180320_008025	Hurry.{nl}The smoke is getting more intense!
QUEST_20180320_008026	It's a disaster!{nl}The demons attacked our rearguard!
QUEST_20180320_008027	All of our supplies are there!{nl}If the demons destroy them we're doomed!{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008028	Please, can you help us with the demons?
QUEST_20180320_008029	They attacked when there was no one at the assembly area...{nl}Hurry!
QUEST_20180320_008030	Move, now!
QUEST_20180320_008031	There's no doubt Elder Henika was one of the people colliding with the demons!{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008032	There were rumors saying Ignas had sided with them...{nl}I guess they were true.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008033	I must tell Elder Ramunas.
QUEST_20180320_008034	I'm going there now!
QUEST_20180320_008035	Elder Henika...{nl}If Ignas really did side with the demons, it's plausible, yes.
QUEST_20180320_008036	There are two magic circles inside the Astral Tower leading to this area.{nl}Now, I know where those circles were installed, so I don't think Henika will have used them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008037	Not only that, our soldiers have an eye on that area at all times, they would have told us immediately if something happened.{nl}That means Ignas' side must have made a new magic circle to teleport here and attack us.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008038	If they attacked the rearguard, the magic circle must have been near 85 Waters...{nl}Will you check if anything's there?
QUEST_20180320_008039	I'll give you this detector.{nl}You can use it to find any magic circles that may be hidden.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008040	If you do find one, don't hesitate. Destroy it immediately.{nl}The magic circles we were watching must also be destroyed.
QUEST_20180320_008041	Alright, hurry out to 85 Waters.{nl}If there's any magic circle there, it'll be near the rearguard.
QUEST_20180320_008042	Very good.{nl}The other magic circles were also destroyed. They have no way to launch a sudden attack now.
QUEST_20180320_008043	And... there is something I should tell you.{nl}I heard this a long time ago, when I was still in the Schaffenstar, from the old head of the Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008044	They didn't say too much about it but...{nl}They mentioned that Lydia Schaffen kept certain... provisions around the Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008045	A kind of tool to use in case the Astral Tower was to face any sort of threat.{nl}Again, I don't know the details, but there's no doubt we could use something like that right now.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008046	I mean, look at what's happening! The Tower's been completely taken by demons after Medzio Diena!{nl}As a Revelator, do you think you can find Schaffen's provisions?
QUEST_20180320_008047	Thank you for doing this.{nl}From what I remember, the way to find Schaffen's provisions began at the top of Rombas Hill Road...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008048	My guess is that one of the provisions could be hidden in this area.{nl}You might find the clues for it will be on Rombas Hill Road.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008049	It won't be easy recovering Schaffen's provisions... I suggest you take Lehon with you.
QUEST_20180320_008050	Elder Ramunas said that?
QUEST_20180320_008051	If he mentioned Rombas Hill Road, there must be something there...{nl}Oh! I remember seeing an old tombstone at the end of the road, could that be a lead?
QUEST_20180320_008052	We should investigate all the possible clues one by one.
QUEST_20180320_008053	So the secret really was in the tombstone... It only revealed itself because you approached it.{nl}May I see the disk?
QUEST_20180320_008054	This is only one half of the disk, I can't make out what it says...{nl}It only mentions the Senoves Altar.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008055	There could be something hidden there!
QUEST_20180320_008056	This is the other half of the disk!{nl}To think something like this was hidden in the altar...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008057	Let me have a look at the disk.
QUEST_20180320_008058	The disk says something is waiting at the Patogus Shelter.{nl}I don't know what exactly is waiting there... but we should find out! Let's go.
QUEST_20180320_008059	What is a little girl doing in a dangerous place like this...?{nl}And... what was she talking about?
QUEST_20180320_008060	I think she was talking about an altar and the disk...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008061	Oh! There's an altar at the shelter. Should we try and place the disk there?
QUEST_20180320_008062	Let's go!
QUEST_20180320_008063	This means Lydia Schaffen's provisions were all a plan of Goddess Laima...
QUEST_20180320_008064	These Orbs could be the answer to our problems.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008065	Go back to Elder Ramunas. Tell him about what happened and show him the Orbs.{nl}I'll clear the shelter first and join you later.
QUEST_20180320_008066	Go! You must tell Elder Ramunas about what we found!
QUEST_20180320_008067	Is this true?{nl}Schaffen's provisions were a plan of Goddess Laima...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008068	And these Orbs, so full of divine energy...{nl}The commander arrived not long ago, he should know about this.
QUEST_20180320_008069	Did you speak with Elder Ramunas?
QUEST_20180320_008070	We finally meet. I heard all about you.{nl}My name's Byle.
QUEST_20180320_008071	Go ahead and speak to the commander.
QUEST_20180320_008072	Are you saying this Orb can detect demons disguised as humans?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008073	I find it hard to believe there are actual demons on Ignas' side...{nl}But looking at what's happened so far, I do see the possibility.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008074	The members siding with Ignas now will certainly change their minds if they find out.{nl}Imagine finding out the leaders of your camp were demons all along.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008075	I have an idea.{nl}We plant these Orbs near the Raikinas Lowlands.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008076	Then, we lure the demons disguised as humans out to the field...{nl}And we wait for the Orbs to react.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008077	They might figure out we're up to something if I do it...{nl}If it's not asking too much, would you plant the Orbs yourself?
QUEST_20180320_008078	Planting the Orbs in three different locations should be enough.
QUEST_20180320_008079	Are the Orbs planted?
QUEST_20180320_008080	Good!
QUEST_20180320_008081	Now to lure out Ignas' demon commanders.
QUEST_20180320_008082	It's a success!{nl}You've done a great job, Revelator.
QUEST_20180320_008083	It's time to move on to the next area and take back the Astral Tower.{nl}Would you join me?
QUEST_20180320_008084	The water point of this region is also broken.{nl}Fortunately I think we can get it to work again with the documents you gave me.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008085	I'm afraid we have no Magic Stones to operate the controllers.{nl}Though remember hearing they used to load them with stones carrying the energy of the lake in the past.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008086	And the documents only say that the controllers need a means for the magic reaction...{nl}Maybe it doesn't have to be Magic Stones!{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008087	Besides, we have no time to waste. Some lake energy stones will have to do.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008088	The Atskiras Lot has a lot of stones. Would you go and collect some for me?
QUEST_20180320_008089	I would go with you, but if I do the assembly area will have no one to look after it.{nl}I'm sorry. Good luck.
QUEST_20180320_008090	Did you look for the stones at the Lot?
QUEST_20180320_008091	This seems enough.
QUEST_20180320_008092	As you know from working on the other water points, you need to place the stones in a certain number and a certain order.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008093	For our water point...{nl}It says 1, 2 and 3 stones per controller, placed clockwise in order.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008094	Since you're already familiar with the water points, will you go and get ours restarted?
QUEST_20180320_008095	Oh, and about the magic circles for the Water Facility.{nl}The page in the document was ripped, so I couldn't tell for sure...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008096	But if I remember correctly, you need to transform all the magic circles around the water point.{nl}And there's a type of preventive device... a trap, if you will.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008097	If you see anything that looks like that, just try to avoid it.
QUEST_20180320_008098	Is the water point working now?{nl}Remember the right order and number of stones.
QUEST_20180320_008099	The water point is working now?{nl}That's good to hear, thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008100	The members on Ignas' camp are starting to doubt him after finding out they were siding with demons.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008101	If we can convince them, they'll be a great help in taking back the Astral Tower.{nl}Would you give us a hand?
QUEST_20180320_008102	I do believe it will be more effective if you're the one who talks to them.{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_20180320_008103	Imagine how much stronger we'll be if we have all the members on our side.
QUEST_20180320_008104	You persuaded all the members.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008105	There are too many demons around, we can barely move.{nl}Would you clear the area for us?
QUEST_20180320_008106	I'll be here resting. Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008107	Did you clear some of the demons nearby?
QUEST_20180320_008108	There are a lot fewer demons now.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008109	I heard a lot about you, Revelator.{nl}Commander Byle has just arrived, too. It seems the demon that's occupying the region is none other than Pbeta.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008110	Oh, I almost forgot. My name is Morvio, I'm a student of the Ranger Master.{nl}She asked me to come and help the resistance soldiers, so here I am.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008111	You may not know this, but the situation is very, very serious.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008112	Pbeta has planted mind-controlling stones across the region to command the monsters.{nl}Apparently the strong energy of the stones is enough to completely hypnotize them.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008113	You and Commander Byle should discuss what to do.
QUEST_20180320_008114	I'll be waiting.
QUEST_20180320_008115	Looks like you already met Morvio.{nl}Oort is also here to help the resistance soldiers.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008116	They came to me not long ago and I sent them here to scout the area.{nl}There had been sightings of a high-rank demon nearby, so I thought we should investigate.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008117	The demon is most likely Pbeta, who was rumored to have collided with Ignas.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008118	As you know, we're a little short-handed...{nl}Not just to take over the Astral Tower, but to defeat Pbeta most of all.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008119	Please, help the Master's students defeat Pbeta.
QUEST_20180320_008120	Have you talked to Commander Byle yet?
QUEST_20180320_008121	We can't refuse an order from Commander Byle.{nl}Let's go.
QUEST_20180320_008122	I wonder if my request wasn't too much for you and the students.
QUEST_20180320_008123	If we're going to get to Pbeta, first we need to destroy his mind-controlling Magic Stones.{nl}That will at least keep the monsters away from us.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008124	Would you start by doing that?
QUEST_20180320_008125	Before destroying the stones, use this Absorbing Stone to soak up the evil energy of Pbeta's Magic Stones.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008126	There's no telling how Pbeta's stones will react if you try to destroy them while the energy is still flowing...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008127	I wish I could come along, but I'm afraid the monsters will tell we're up to something if we go together...{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_20180320_008128	The energy of Pbeta's Magic Stones is spreading throughout the entire region.{nl}I never felt anything like this.
QUEST_20180320_008129	You destroyed the Magic Stones!{nl}But now... the energy coming from the Absorbing Stone is creeping me out.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008130	I'll think of a way to dispose of the energy.
QUEST_20180320_008131	Did you feel the energy that was spreading around here?{nl}The evil energy you took with that Absorbing Stone!{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008132	You know, they keep very dangerous things deep inside the Astral Tower.{nl}Including the essence of Ziburynas, the demon lord who was defeated by Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008133	I saw it once, when I was working inside the Tower.{nl}I'll never forget the awful energy I felt then.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008134	But now... I can feel it again! It's the same energy, spreading all over the region!{nl}What if... Ignas took the essence of Ziburynas and gave it to Pbeta?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008135	You might have heard that Lydia Schaffen killed Ziburynas with a powerful arrow called the Flechette.{nl}Maybe the Fletcher Master can help us find a way to fight Ziburynas' essence.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008136	If that's alright with you, would you pay a visit to the Fletcher Master?
QUEST_20180320_008137	He should be at the Goddess' Ancient Garden.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008138	Oh, and it seems he sent one of his students over to help, but they're still nowhere to be seen.{nl}I wonder if something happened... Do check with the Fletcher Master.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008139	The essence of Ziburynas... This is very serious.
QUEST_20180320_008140	Did you visit the Fletcher Master yet?
QUEST_20180320_008141	Yes, Lydia Schaffen killed Ziburynas a long time go.{nl}But do you know how she did it? It was all thanks to the Flechette, a mighty arrow created by my ancestors.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008142	I have yet to find it but... I did my research on it.{nl}I found a way to produce an arrow that's almost as powerful as the original Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008143	I can hand you the instructions. Please deliver them to my student.
QUEST_20180320_008144	It's already been a few days since he left...{nl}If you go now, he should be there when you arrive.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008145	And make sure you keep an eye on that Earth Essence. My student didn't take any, so it's very important that you don't lose it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008146	Those are some great things he handed you.{nl}And his student is here, too.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008147	Go and give him the things.
QUEST_20180320_008148	Did you give everything to the Fletcher Master's student yet?
QUEST_20180320_008149	The Master gave these to you?
QUEST_20180320_008150	The student arrived just after you left.{nl}Looks like you just went different ways.
QUEST_20180320_008151	It looks like the situation is serious, from these instructions.{nl}I heard a big demon was in the area.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008152	An arrow like this would be extremely helpful to face a demon like Pbeta...{nl}But I'm missing the materials for the arrowhead.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008153	I did notice some natural Obsidian on the way to 86 Waters.{nl}If we're lucky, they could contain some magic...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008154	I think I can make a good arrowhead with some of that Obsidian.{nl}If it's not asking too much, would you collect some for me?
QUEST_20180320_008155	I'll be preparing the tools to process the mineral meanwhile.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008156	Did you bring the Obsidian?
QUEST_20180320_008157	This is enough.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_20180320_008158	Come to think of it, I'm also short on materials for the fletching.{nl}But I believe there are Humming Dukes nearby...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008159	Humming Duke feathers are flexible but durable. They'll make for good fletching materials.{nl}Would you collect some for me?
QUEST_20180320_008160	Thank you.{nl}I'll go ahead and make the arrowhead first.
QUEST_20180320_008161	Please make sure the feathers don't get damaged, otherwise I can't use them.
QUEST_20180320_008162	That's a lot of feathers.{nl}I'll have to throw away some of the long white ones, but the rest look good enough to use for the fletching.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008163	Just wait for a moment while I craft the arrow.
QUEST_20180320_008164	Hunter Oort
QUEST_20180320_008165	Sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I'm Oort.{nl}My Master sent me out here to help the resistance soldiers...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008166	But it looks like we're going to have to face Pbeta now. Is that right?{nl}Won't we have to deal with his subordinates as well? I think we should prepare for that.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008167	There's a highly poisonous plant growing near the old garden called Ziburyte.{nl}Would you bring me some?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008168	I can use the Ziburyte to make a series of traps for Pbeta's subordinates.
QUEST_20180320_008169	I'll stay here and prepare the other tools for the traps.{nl}Just be careful when collecting the Ziburyte. It's very poisonous.
QUEST_20180320_008170	Where's the Ziburyte?{nl}Please, hurry.
QUEST_20180320_008171	You're back!{nl}Hold on a moment.
QUEST_20180320_008172	The traps are ready.{nl}Please set them up on the way to Pbeta's location.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008173	The poison in these traps is very strong. It should be enough to hit even very large monsters.
QUEST_20180320_008174	Oh, it looks like Voleta is done with the arrows.{nl}You can take Morvio and Voleta, then.
QUEST_20180320_008175	After you set up the traps, make sure to avoid the area.{nl}The poison will start spreading immediately if one of them is triggered.
QUEST_20180320_008176	All the traps are in place now?
QUEST_20180320_008177	Alright, let's move.{nl}We should hurry, in case Pbeta tries anything.
QUEST_20180320_008178	Be careful not to let Pbeta find out we're after him.
QUEST_20180320_008179	Revelator, have you made your decision?{nl}Whatever you think is best, we'll follow.
QUEST_20180320_008180	Understood.{nl}I'll fire the arrow as soon I see Pbeta.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008181	Morvio is going to stay and look out for Pbeta's subordinates.{nl}Let's go, then.
QUEST_20180320_008182	I'm sorry. Pbeta escaped, there was nothing we could do.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008183	Voleta was hurt trying to stop Pbeta.{nl}We should go first and reunite later.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008184	Now, I think Pbeta stepped on one of the traps when he escaped.{nl}That means it will be easier to follow him.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008185	We need to track him down.
QUEST_20180320_008186	Let's go back to the traps and look for clues!
QUEST_20180320_008187	The trail ends here.{nl}There are no more traces.
QUEST_20180320_008188	I think he escaped to the Astral Tower.{nl}Ignas' men will be all over the entrance to the Tower... it won't be easy.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008189	Revelator, would you go after Pbeta?{nl}I'm going to call for help.
QUEST_20180320_008190	Good luck.
QUEST_20180320_008191	Thank you for everything.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008192	This is as far as we can come with you, Revelator.{nl}I'm afraid our purpose here doesn't relate to the Astral Tower, there's nothing more we can do to help.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008193	Commander Byle also said that...{nl}You have something to do in the Astral Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008194	I don't know what you'll be doing in there, but be careful.{nl}The other students and I are going to stay here for a while.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008195	There are still demons roaming around in the area, we'll go ahead and get rid of them.{nl}I'll see you another time.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008196	May the goddess protect you, Revelator.
QUEST_20180320_008197	Revelator, may I ask you for a favor?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008198	I'm out of food to give to Inas.{nl}Would you hunt some Humming Dukes for me? I could really use some meat.
QUEST_20180320_008199	I would hunt them myself but...{nl}Inas is just too hungry. He's refusing to cooperate.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008200	I'll be very grateful.
QUEST_20180320_008201	Please hurry.
QUEST_20180320_008202	Thank you.{nl}I should hurry and feed Inas now.
QUEST_20180320_008203	I just realized I'm out of water, too.{nl}I think I saw some Pasto water plants nearby.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008204	Pasto plants are known to act as purifiers; I think I can use them to filter some lake water.{nl}Would you collect some water plants for me?
QUEST_20180320_008205	Pasto plants grow underwater, however, so they're hard to spot with the naked eye.{nl}But check the surface of the water for bubbles, you should find them there.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008206	Inas is still a little sensitive, I'm going to have to stay with him for a while.{nl}Thanks for the help.
QUEST_20180320_008207	Did you bring the plants?{nl}I'm getting thirsty already.
QUEST_20180320_008208	Thank you!{nl}This should work for a while.
QUEST_20180320_008209	It took me years, but thanks to you I finally got hold of it.{nl}After you found the Flechette I did my fair share of research on it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008210	And through that research, I found a way to create an arrow as powerful as the Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008211	I know there are other people helping the resistance soldiers from the outside.{nl}My Master was apparently an acquaintance of Elder Ramunas' from the old days.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008212	I don't know who is helping or how, exactly...{nl}But I assume most of them either worked at the Astral Tower or know someone who did.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008213	As you know, the resistance needs soldiers to fight for them, but most of all they need the funds to support themselves.{nl}My guess is that a lot of people are helping with donations.
QUEST_20180320_008214	But officially, Ignas is the rightful head of the Astral Tower, and we aren't connected to their organization...{nl}We have no place in the battle between Ignas and the resistance.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008215	I heard all about what he did from the soldiers, but we just don't have the same responsibility.{nl}All we can do is help indirectly like this.
QUEST_20180320_008216	Elder Ramunas
QUEST_20180320_008217	You probably already heard the story of how Lydia Schaffen defeated Demon Lord Ziburynas.{nl}The story of Schaffen and her Flechette.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008218	After Ziburynas was defeated, Schaffen commanded that the demon's essence was kept in the Tower.{nl}Ziburynas' essence was too dangerous. She didn't want it to fall into the hands of another demon.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008219	And she made the right decision.{nl}Many demons have tried to attack the Tower, but all of them failed.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008220	The rumor went that the Tower was better protected than the royal palace. And that's saying something.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008221	I saw Ziburynas' essence once when I worked at the Tower.{nl}They used to move it around every now and then to keep it safe.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008222	And let me tell you, the energy coming from that essence was evil. Terrifying.{nl}Looking at it felt like falling from an abyss.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008223	I thought the essence would be safe as long as it was kept in the Tower...{nl}Never in my dreams did I think it would be stolen from the inside.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008224	It was Ignas' fault, of course. He sided with the demons.{nl}The head of the Astral Tower, that is.
QUEST_20180320_008225	We abandoned the Astral Tower so we could take it back from Ignas.{nl}He isn't fit to be head of the Tower. 
QUEST_20180320_008226	I head the water point is working again!{nl}That's great news!
QUEST_20180320_008227	I have no doubt Ignas had something to do with the death of the previous leader.{nl}Nothing works anymore ever since he became head of the Tower.
QUEST_20180320_008228	There are even rumors that he's colluding with the demons.{nl}Although not everyone seems to think it's true...
QUEST_20180320_008229	Now that the water point is working, the demons will have to leave the lake.{nl}Of course, it will be a while before all the water is purified...
QUEST_20180320_008230	The Hydra is monster, but not a demon.{nl}Why did it react to the purified water? 
QUEST_20180320_008231	When we first abandoned the Tower, the lake was full of demons.{nl}We managed to clear out the area a little now, but I had no idea the situation was this serious.
QUEST_20180320_008232	I'm glad the water point is working again.{nl}Hopefully we'll be seeing fewer demons around now.
QUEST_20180320_008233	The water points were destroyed while we were still working in the Tower.{nl}For all we know, Ignas could very well be behind all of this.
QUEST_20180320_008234	The other areas have their own Water Facilities.{nl}If we can make all of them work again, the lake will be purified in no time.
QUEST_20180320_008235	All that's left to do now is to take back the Astral Tower.{nl}We're ready to join the commander of 86 Waters.
QUEST_20180320_008236	Resistance Soldier
QUEST_20180320_008237	I'm worried for everyone, but especially the soldiers in 86 Waters.{nl}They have to fight directly against Ignas' camp; the casualties there are higher than anywhere else.
QUEST_20180320_008238	I heard you got the Water Facility to work again.{nl}You don't know how that makes things easier for us.
QUEST_20180320_008239	Be careful when you go to 86 Waters.{nl}If they don't know who you are, you could get yourself into trouble.
QUEST_20180320_008240	Some members of the Astral Tower still haven't taken a side.{nl}My guess is that they're only trying to save themselves.
QUEST_20180320_008241	Commander Kron seems to think Ignas made a deal with the demons.{nl}When you think of everything that's happening, I'd say he's right.
QUEST_20180320_008242	On Medzio Diena, this entire region was overturned.{nl}Many roads and buildings were destroyed because of it.
QUEST_20180320_008243	I hesitated to abandon the Tower at first.{nl}I wasn't ready to stand against the people I considered my peers. 
QUEST_20180320_008244	I heard there are other people supporting us from the outside.{nl}If it wasn't for them... I don't think we'd be able to support ourselves.
QUEST_20180320_008245	This is a conflict zone between Ignas' army and the resistance.{nl}Please refrain from any unnecessary movements.
QUEST_20180320_008246	I'm injured. I can't move like this.{nl}I'm going to have to rest for a while.
QUEST_20180320_008247	We abandoned the Tower to make our own resistance army but... we're still outnumbered.{nl}If only we could get the neutral members to cross over to our side...
QUEST_20180320_008248	We sent a few scouts to the Lanko Waters region... no news from them yet.{nl}They should be back by now...
QUEST_20180320_008249	I can't imagine if Lydia Schaffen were alive to see this...{nl}Our own family split into sides, fighting each other.
QUEST_20180320_008250	Lydia Schaffen's provisions are hidden somewhere in the region.{nl}They could very well be the solution to our problem.
QUEST_20180320_008251	So it's true. Ignas is on the demons' side.{nl}Did he use their influence to become head of the Tower?
QUEST_20180320_008252	Most resistance soldiers are on the front line, fighting against Ignas' army.{nl}To think we all started out as brothers...
QUEST_20180320_008253	Ignas' camp is more numerous than we expected.{nl}If they ever launch a full-scale attack, there's little we can do to stop them.
QUEST_20180320_008254	Ignas had no consideration for the members working in the Astral Tower.{nl}He lost all credibility as a leader.
QUEST_20180320_008255	I don't see any more of Ignas' men around.{nl}We should take care of the demons instead.
QUEST_20180320_008256	I don't know what Lydia Schaffen's provisions are but...{nl}I hope it's something we can use.
QUEST_20180320_008257	Ignas' camp has set out a defensive front line.{nl}Something feels very strange about their commander.
QUEST_20180320_008258	I heard about the strange girl before.{nl}Who would have thought she would appear again to recover Schaffen's provisions...? 
QUEST_20180320_008259	I always suspected Ignas was involved with the demons.{nl}If that's true, the other members need to know about it.
QUEST_20180320_008260	All that's left to do now is return to the Tower.{nl}Ignas' side is no longer sending out its members.
QUEST_20180320_008261	I know one of the scouts that were sent out to Lanko Waters.{nl}There's no news about them yet... I just hope they're safe.
QUEST_20180320_008262	May I know what you're doing here?{nl}You don't look like a soldier... This area is dangerous, you should leave immediately.
QUEST_20180320_008263	What on earth are you doing here?? You need to get out!{nl}This is a war zone, you could get killed out here!
QUEST_20180320_008264	You defeated a demon that was disguised as a human?{nl}Wow, that's amazing.
QUEST_20180320_008265	Can you feel the energy spreading?{nl}I never felt such an evil energy.
QUEST_20180320_008266	I'm going to move on to another region.{nl}Get rid of some more demons there.
QUEST_20180320_008267	Somewhere in this region is Pbeta, the demon Ignas is siding with.{nl}I still can't understand why he would do such a thing.
QUEST_20180320_008268	I'd say Ignas probably gave away Ziburynas' essence to Pbeta.{nl}The man has to be out of his mind to do something like that.
QUEST_20180320_008269	I can't help but be amazed at the fact that the Fletcher Master created an arrow like this.{nl}This could really help us defeat Pbeta.
QUEST_20180320_008270	I'm glad the arrow was effective.{nl}I think I'll stay here for a little longer and tend to my wounds.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008271	I wish I could join you, but I need to recover...{nl}I wouldn't be able to enter the Astral Tower anyway...
QUEST_20180320_008272	From what I was told, Ignas was behind the death of the previous head of the Tower.{nl}I don't know if that's true, but those were the rumors.
QUEST_20180320_008273	I'm glad my traps were useful.{nl}If it wasn't for them, we would never be able to track Pbeta. 
QUEST_20180320_008274	Pbeta must have been carrying part of Ziburynas' essence.{nl}It's good that at least part of it is gone now.
QUEST_20180320_008275	The evil energy is spreading throughout the entire region.{nl}If Pbeta is the source of this energy... our job won't be easy.
QUEST_20180320_008276	I heard Pbeta is carrying a very powerful source of energy...{nl}We can only hope Voleta's arrow works.
QUEST_20180320_008277	Pbeta was hurt by the traps and Voleta's arrow...{nl}It's only a matter of time now before he's defeated!
QUEST_20180320_008278	I'm sure the arrow will work.{nl}As long as Pbeta stays in the dark, we have a real chance of getting to him.
QUEST_20180320_008279	Aghh... I'm sorry, I don't think I can go on like this...{nl}Go, Revelator. Go and defeat Pbeta.
QUEST_20180320_008280	This entire region was overturned on Medzio Diena.{nl}A lot of roads were destroyed because of that.
QUEST_20180320_008281	The villages around the lake were all affected by Medzio Diena.{nl}All the members that had family in those villages were so worried.
QUEST_20180320_008282	There's a controller device between the two magic circles.{nl}Maybe the controller needs to be operated in a certain way.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008283	Looking at the first magic circles, they seem to have the same color.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008284	If we can use the controller to change the color of the magic circles...{nl}How about we try setting them all to different colors?
QUEST_20180320_008285	What you did was remarkable.{nl}I say your talent is impressive, even for a Revelator.

QUEST_20180320_008297	There's an old pillar here.
QUEST_20180320_008298	There doesn't seem to be a reaction.
QUEST_20180320_008299	The spheres shine brighter when they are closer to the pillar.{nl}Inspect the pillar?
QUEST_20180320_008300	Damaged Stone Plate
QUEST_20180320_008301	There's an image engraved on the stone plate.{nl}The full image only becomes visible when all the plates come together.
QUEST_20180320_008302	Damaged Monument
QUEST_20180320_008303	There's a damaged tombstone.
QUEST_20180320_008304	The stone plates are slowly starting to form an image.
QUEST_20180320_008305	It looks like the image of a person moving.{nl}Try a few gestures in front of the tombstone.
QUEST_20180320_008306	There's an image on the tombstone, but because of the holes it's impossible to make out.

QUEST_20180320_008315	The Firestone was sucked into the lantern, but there was no reaction.
QUEST_20180320_008316	Oh, it's nice to see you.{nl}If you aren't busy, would you mind giving me a hand?
QUEST_20180320_008317	Alright, I understand.
QUEST_20180320_008318	Would you happen to know about the Onmyoji?{nl}They arrived in our nation around the Kingdom's millenary to assist in the royal court.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008319	Now it seems the Onmyoji Master is in a bit of a difficult situation.{nl}His country is using his status to make some rather unreasonable demands to our Kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008320	The Master's nation was also affected by Medzio Diena, you see...{nl}And according to them, the fact that the disaster started in our capital is reason enough for them to demand material aid.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008321	Their requests are certainly excessive...{nl}But if you consider all that the Onmyoji have done for the Kingdom and its subjects, it's hard for us to refuse, don't you think?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008322	I've asked a few acquaintances to help the Onmyoji Master gather relief material for his country.{nl}Fortunately, most of them were glad to cooperate.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008323	Now, the Onmyoji Master left to visit his home country and announce our assistance, but it seems he'll be returning to the Kingdom a little earlier than expected.{nl}

QUEST_20180320_008416	Right, right. You said you needed me to sail a ship, was it?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008417	A trip like that isn't cheap, you know?{nl}But alright. Since you found me the darned brooch.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008418	Just let the Corsair Master know, will you?{nl}Not a lot of captains are up this job, you know? I'll do him the favor.
QUEST_20180320_008419	You can let the Corsair Master know I'm sailing the ship.{nl}You're lucky my mood's right again after I got that brooch back.
QUEST_20180320_008420	50 monsters later, the captain's brooch is still nowhere to be found.{nl}But it's still too early to give up. Keep trying.
QUEST_20180320_008421	That's more than 100 monsters now.{nl}But the captain is certain the brooch is with the Brown Lapasapes, so keep trying.
QUEST_20180320_008422	The Brown Lapasapes seem to have turned more violent.{nl}Is it because of the smell of blood?
QUEST_20180320_008423	Found an object that looks like the captain's brooch.{nl}Go back to him and return the brooch.
QUEST_20180320_008424	Ye solved everything with Lowe, did you?{nl}Aye. Tell Uska he's got his captain.
QUEST_20180320_008425	Ho ho. Got the old scallywag chirping again, ready to sail.
QUEST_20180320_008426	Oh, you're here to check on the supplies for the Onmyoji Master.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008427	I'm almost done preparing all the medical supplies for the donation...{nl}But there is one thing I'm missing.{nl}It's a type of blood circulation supplement I'm trying to produce. Unfortunately I still don't have all the materials for it.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008428	It's going to take some time for me to gather everything...{nl}Although, if you can find me some Hard Thistles, that would cut it down by quite a lot.{nl}What do you say?
QUEST_20180320_008429	Hard Thistles are found in Barha Forest and Nahash Forest.{nl}I'd like you to bring back about 15 Hard Thistles.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008430	If you can't find them at first, look for the purple spots.{nl}The thistles in those regions contain a substance that makes them glow in a very characteristic shade of purple.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008431	I'll gather the rest of the materials meanwhile.
QUEST_20180320_008432	Hard Thistles are found in Barha Forest and Nahash Forest.{nl}I'd like you to bring back about 15 Hard Thistles.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008433	The thistles in those regions contain a substance that makes them glow in a very characteristic shade of purple, so look out for the purple spots.
QUEST_20180320_008434	Excellent. These are exactly the kind of Hard Thistles I was looking for.{nl}Thank you.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008435	Revelator, would you mind doing me another favor?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008436	In my research camp just down the road I have four piles of boxes with medical supplies.{nl}They're all set to be shipped, but I think I have their quantities mixed up.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008437	While I'm working on the blood circulation supplement, would you go there and check the stock of each supply?
QUEST_20180320_008438	The supply boxes are at my research camp.{nl}Just check the amount of each type of supply in the four box piles.
QUEST_20180320_008439	Did you count all the supplies?
QUEST_20180320_008440	Medical Supplies
QUEST_20180320_008441	Fever Medicine - 1,460{nl}Small Bandages - 2,970
QUEST_20180320_008442	Antiseptic - 1,630{nl}Pain Medication - 2,150
QUEST_20180320_008443	Ointment - 2,470{nl}Antihemorrhagic Drug - 1,390
QUEST_20180320_008444	Large Bandages - 1,850{nl}Bandaids - 2,260
QUEST_20180320_008445	How many doses of fever and pain medication were there in total?
QUEST_20180320_008446	How many doses of antihemorrhagic drug and antiseptic were there in total?
QUEST_20180320_008447	How many doses of ointment and bandaids were there in total?
QUEST_20180320_008448	How many small and large bandages were there in total?
QUEST_20180320_008449	Those numbers are slightly different from what I had noted.{nl}Would you mind checking one more time?
QUEST_20180320_008450	Ah, yes. The numbers seem right.{nl}You can tell Uska I will have all the medical supplies ready for the donation.
QUEST_20180320_008451	I also had time to prepare the blood circulation supplement. Everything is ready to be shipped.
QUEST_20180320_008452	You came to check on how the donation is doing, did you?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008453	I just talked to headquarters a few days ago.{nl}I'm gonna be in charge of managing the whole fund transfer, you know?{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008454	Everything was sailing smooth, until...{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008455	This piece of cargo got lost somehow on its way to some Alliance executives.{nl}And not just any cargo; Dimensional Stones! You can guess how that went.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008456	We don't know how it got lost, but now I got to find it and get it delivered ASAP.{nl}So I'd love to help, but you got to give me a hand with this thing first. What do you say?
QUEST_20180320_008457	Alright, I'll hand you the detector.{nl}There ain't much to it. Just go to Grand Yard Mesa and look around with the detector, see if it reacts.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008458	The Dimensional Stones are going to be inside the sacks buried there, just use the detector and fish them out.{nl}They'll be about 15 Stones in total.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008459	Don't ask me how a bunch of Dimensional Stones ended up in those sacks. Just get them out.
QUEST_20180320_008460	Get the detector I gave you to Grand Yard Mesa and see if it reacts to any of the sacks there.{nl}I need you to find me the 15 Dimensional Stones.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008461	I made that detector myself when I was out getting Dimensional Stone samples in Grand Yard Mesa. Worked like a charm, so don't worry.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008462	I'm afraid there's nothing else I can tell you about what happened to those Dimensional Stones... It's all confidential, you know.
QUEST_20180320_008463	Oh, you got them all out. Good, good.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008464	Oh, and, um... Let's keep this between you me, hey pal?{nl}I'll make sure to send someone to Uska with the funds today.
QUEST_20180320_008465	You understand why this needs to stay between you and me, right?{nl}Don't worry, I'm sending the funds to Uska in time for the whole thing.
QUEST_20180320_008466	Something nearby is shining.
QUEST_20180320_008467	Oh, you came to check on the donations for the Onmyoji nation.{nl}Yeah, I heard about it from the Master.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008468	The farmers here are helping us collect grains and cereals, so no issues there... The problem is keeping the food safe.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008469	Having all these piles of grain around attracts too many bugs.{nl}If it's not too much to ask, would you protect the cereals with some magic?
QUEST_20180320_008470	We store the grain in the Kvie Farm Area. There's around 9 bags of grain there.{nl}The scroll I just gave you is for a spell that keeps the bugs away from the food.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008471	It's a really useful spell, but there is one downside.{nl}The magic of the scroll isn't that potent, you'll have to apply to the bags of grain one by one.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008472	Use it only on the bags that are full.{nl}If you go now, you're going to need to apply the spell about 20 times.
QUEST_20180320_008473	There are 9 bags of grain in the Kvie Farm Area.{nl}If you see a bag that's full, use the scroll I gave you to apply the protective magic.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008474	You're going to need to apply the magic about 20 times for it to work.
QUEST_20180320_008475	Good, you did it!{nl}Uska will be happy to hear we'll have the donations ready in time.
QUEST_20180320_008476	It's all thanks to you, Revelator.{nl}We really appreciate the help.
QUEST_20180320_008477	Is something wrong?
QUEST_20180320_008478	Oh, you only need to pay a visit to the people who are gathering donations for the Onmyoji Master's country and check on their progress.{nl}Don't forget the list I handed you earlier. All the details about the supporters are there.
QUEST_20180320_008479	Ah, glad to hear all the preparations are on schedule.{nl}As it happens, the Onmyoji Master has just arrived in Klaipeda.{nl}You might want to go and have a word with him.
QUEST_20180320_008480	The Onmyoji Master is here in the city of Klaipeda.
QUEST_20180320_008481	Onmyoji Master
QUEST_20180320_008482	You must be the Revelator Mr. Uska spoke to me about.{nl}How nice to finally meet you. My name is Ahiro Seimei, I work in the Kingdom as Onmyoji Master.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008483	Mr. Uska told me you assisted him in managing the donations. That's very kind of you.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008484	I have to say, I was worried for the Kingdom after my country began making all those demands.{nl}I'm eternally grateful to Mr. Uska and all our generous supporters.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008485	The authorities seem content enough with the agreement reached for the donations.{nl}It is a favor I'm looking forward to repay with my service to the Kingdom and its people.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008486	Do find me again if you're ever interested in knowing more about the Onmyoji.{nl}I'm sure my country won't object, not after all the help you've given us.
QUEST_20180320_008487	Becoming an Onmyoji requires strong concentration and mental power.{nl}These two elements are crucial for anyone looking to commune with the Divine Spirits.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008488	Many specialists in this field were formally taught in my home country.{nl}Here, too, in the Kingdom, the previous Onmyoji Master founded a special training zone for future Onmyoji students.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008489	The training zone is located in Sventimas Exile.{nl}Would you like to have a look and begin training there?
QUEST_20180320_008490	Glad to see you again.{nl}The Onmyoji training zone is located in Sventimas Exile. That is where you can begin your instruction.
QUEST_20180320_008491	The board is called a Shikiban. Originally it is used for divination, but this one was developed especially to train new Onmyoji.{nl}If you take it to the training zone in Sventimas Exile, the Shikiban will reveal an area surrounded by a magic barrier.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008492	Inside the barrier, each of the paper dolls is moving in a certain direction.{nl}Use the Shikiban to control the trajectory of the dolls and cause them to collide with one another.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008493	Each time you use the Shikiban on a paper doll, its direction will change 90 degrees counterclockwise.{nl}Observe the dolls closely before using the board.
QUEST_20180320_008494	Controlling the paper dolls may not be easy, but you must be willing to persevere.
QUEST_20180320_008495	Congratulations, you are closer to the limits of your potential.{nl}But I beg you. Do not think lightly of the task that is communing with the Divine Spirits.
QUEST_20180320_008496	One's concentration and mental power must, too, be honed in moderation.{nl}You may want to take some time and rest before resuming your training.
QUEST_20180320_008497	The harmony of Yin and Yang was broken on Medzio Diena.{nl}After the disaster, I came to realize once again the great role of the goddesses in maintaining the natural balance.{nl} 
QUEST_20180320_008498	My home country was also very much affected by the aftermath of Medzio Diena, but I believe the answer is here in the Kingdom.{nl}I pray every day that the people and Divine Spirits of my motherland can persist through these dark days.
QUEST_20180320_008499	The true power of the Onmyoji will only manifest itself when Yin and Yang become one.
QUEST_20180320_008500	Fortunately, the mushroom samples you collected were not contaminated.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008501	Please let Uska know that I'll be delivering the samples myself.{nl}And thank you for all the help.
QUEST_20180320_008502	Fortunately, the grape seed samples you collected were not contaminated.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008504	In a hidden alley of Fedimian, an old man expired his last breath under Rexipher's deadly grip. The demon threw the man's body on the ground and let out a sigh.{nl}He knew killing a human with his own hands was worth nothing, and that frustrated Rexipher more than anything.{nl} 
QUEST_20180320_008505	Decades had passed since Gesti, his superior, first assigned him the task where he was yet to succeed.{nl}All he had achieved was the daily experience of just how meticulously King Zachariel's mausoleum had been constructed. For years he poured his efforts into infiltrating the mausoleum by force, to no avail. It was only recently that Rexipher had begun to consider other methods.
QUEST_20180320_008506	He had decided to swallow his pride and use the humans.{nl}Zachariel, the owner of the mausoleum, was no longer alive, but he could still target those who helped build it. And so, Rexipher began to wander the Kingdom in search of clues from any human involved in the construction of the mausoleum.{nl}Destiny would have it that even those efforts would be in vain. Nothing had escaped King Zachariel's plans.
QUEST_20180320_008507	 There was a chance it had all been in Laima's prophecy.{nl}As hard as he looked, there wasn't a single document, blueprint or construction plan left in the Kingdom. No human who had worked on the mausoleum had any recollection of it.{nl}All he found was that King Zachariel had hired the most talented wizards of the time to erase their memories through magic not even a demon lord like himself could undo.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008508	If only he had chased after those humans before the decades had passed, before time took so many of their short lives, there was a slight chance he would have gotten the advantage over Zachariel. Now, Rexipher could do nothing but regret the years spent attempting to force his way into the mausoleum.
QUEST_20180320_008509	During his ventures in the Kingdom, Rexipher often followed groups of thieves and grave robbers, at times adopting a human form to employ them.
QUEST_20180320_008510	That, of course, was as fruitless as any other of his schemes.{nl}King Zachariel's mausoleum had been built to keep out both demons and ordinary thieves alike.{nl}The structure was impossibly sealed and seemed forever inaccessible.
QUEST_20180320_008511	Rexipher found it hard to believe it had been planned by a human at all.{nl}But he wasn't ready to give up. The fear of Gesti's ire and the refusal to be outsmarted by a mortal kept him going.
QUEST_20180320_008512	 He was just about to return to the mausoleum after his trip to Fedimian, where he had gone to gather more information.{nl}He looked around before preparing to teleport to his destination. Teleportation was not unheard of to wizards and other magic users in the Kingdom, but in his human form Rexipher preferred not to call too much attention to himself.{nl}
QUEST_20180320_008513	Then, he noticed someone looking at him; a man was walking in his direction. Oddly, he didn't seem bothered by the body lying motionless at Rexipher's feet.{nl}He stopped in front of the demon and greeted him courteously. [Pleased to meet you.]{nl}Rexipher noticed the man hadn't used the typical human 'Hello' and wondered whether there was more to him than what his common appearance let on. He skipped the introductions. [You know a lot for a human, don't you?]
QUEST_20180320_008514	The man replied.{nl}[My name is Rirumras Jonas. Our Great King committed to my family an official order regarding individuals – human or otherwise – such as yourself. I am here to honor His Majesty's royal order.]{nl}Taken aback by the man's response, Rexipher couldn't help but ask.{nl}[What are you talking about?]
QUEST_20180320_008515	[The King invested great efforts to ensure that his eternal mausoleum would remain secure without the need for a keeper. As far as we know, the mausoleum contains an object that will be extremely important in the future. No one knows when it will be needed: it could be in a thousand, even two thousand years.{nl}Because of this, the mausoleum's facilities were designed to remain dormant until the time when that important object becomes necessary.{nl}Therefore, one would be required to wait until the mausoleum becomes accessible. Of course, some devices in the mausoleum can be activated from the outside, but they cannot be shut down again.
QUEST_20180320_008516	Not only that, most members of the court have no knowledge of how to operate said devices. Only a few select families and individuals keep partial information on the system.]{nl}[Why are you telling me this?]
QUEST_20180320_008517	[First, I want to confirm whether you are the kind of person we are required to watch.]{nl}Rexipher replied. [So you want to know if I'm one of those so-called demons.]{nl}[Correct.][I am. I won't try and deny it. Now that it's confirmed, what are you going to do about it?]
QUEST_20180320_008518	[My family is responsible for activating certain devices in the mausoleum in the event of an attempted breach, not only by human thieves but especially by a demon such as yourself.{nl}After the devices are activated, the mausoleum will generate a stronger defensive response to demon trespassers.]{nl}[Stronger than what it already is?]{nl}[There's always the chance that the structure may deteriorate with time, but yes.]{nl}[What if I were to kill you here and now?]
QUEST_20180320_008519	[I was fully aware of that possibility when I made the decision to approach you.{nl}Alas, my family will activate the devices even if I am to die. They will withhold action if – and only if – I return to tell them that you were neither a demon, nor a human under demon influence. It is not a question of whether I am alive or not.{nl}I should also warn you that my family will not be deceived by any demon attempting to impersonate me.]{nl}[Of course. Zachariel really did his homework, didn't he?]
QUEST_20180320_008520	{nl}Rexipher and the Royal Mausoleum Vol.2
QUEST_20180320_008521	Jonas continued. [I don't know how long my family may survive, but we and everyone affiliated with us carries their own designated mission. Some of us do what I am doing, some of us keep records, and so on.{nl}However, even if our families become extinct or can no longer serve under His Majesty's command, the mausoleum was designed to resist transgressions for many eras to come.{nl}All we are doing is helping maintain the mausoleum's security in any way we can. You see, the King prepared the mausoleum to withstand a thousand years, but he also made provisions for the event that it was required to remain closed for longer. I, for one, am quite pleased that we're able to fulfill one of our missions in such a short time after the completion of the mausoleum.]
QUEST_20180320_008522	Rexipher followed. [Can I ask you something?]{nl}[Yes, what is it?]{nl}[Why did you come here to tell me that? When you could have confirmed that I was a demon otherwise and activated the mausoleum without saying a word to me.]{nl}[Allow me to explain. You see, there is something I must let you know.]
QUEST_20180320_008523	With that, Jonas pulled out a small piece of paper and offered it to Rexipher.{nl}[Read this. It tells you that His Majesty left deliberate clues around the plateau near the mausoleum. The clues will tell you what you need to know if you're looking to approach the mausoleum.]{nl}The demon focused on the small memo. Jonas continued.
QUEST_20180320_008524	[What do you say? As you can see from these notes, there's a slight chance that the mausoleum can be unlocked. How about you go back and resume what you were doing?]{nl}[What sort of trick is this? Doesn't this put you at a disadvantage? Why would you try and please me?]
QUEST_20180320_008525	Jonas replied. [It's very simple, from what I was told. You, as a demon, have the ability to hold onto the mausoleum for many, many eras to come. That alone will prove to be very meaningful at a future time, though we don't know why or how. Perhaps your powers will be used for a just purpose. In any case, this is a decision you will find hard to avoid.]{nl}It was true. Rexipher had no choice but to follow through with Gesti's orders. He couldn't bear admit to a fellow demon that he had failed to force his way into the tomb of a mere human.{nl}All he could do now was pursue the fate Laima had set out, perpetuated in the actions of the man in front of him and his peers. Rexipher knew this was not Jonas' vision. It had all been planned decades before by Laima Herself and King Zachariel.
QUEST_20180320_008526	Determined to win at any cost, the demon spared his words. Jonas had already told him all he needed to know. Rexipher quietly took the man's life and disappeared.{nl}The mystery that lied before him would not be deciphered for another millennium but, for now, Rexipher remained unaware of the tremendous hardship that was to come.

QUEST_20180418_008670	* Hayraven's Unofficial Chronicles Part 1
QUEST_20180418_008671	The Great Pirate Vladislovas.{nl}With each step, in the shadow of his footsteps remained the blood of his defeated enemies. Demons bowed their heads and drew away in his presence. In front of the ruthless Vladislovas stood a much younger Hayraven.{nl}From the splashing waves to the rocking boats, all became silent. Even the seagulls soaring up high had quieted down to watch them.{nl}There was no prize for the winner of this battle; the fight was for the title of Great Pirate.{nl}Hayraven drew his cutlass and began by attacking Vladislovas in swift steps, aiming once for his chest, twice for each side of his torso.
QUEST_20180418_008672	But his attacks were too obvious for Vladislovas.{nl}Grabbing ahold of Hayraven's cutlass, he kicked him in the pit of his stomach, knocking him over.{nl}Then, as if to teach the younger pirate a lesson, he hit Hayraven with the hilt of his sword again and again.
QUEST_20180418_008673	Hayraven barely escaped the cruel pirate's attack to regain his footing.{nl}He was already injured, and Vladislovas looked set for victory. Hayraven swallowed once.
QUEST_20180418_008674	If he were to surrender, the brutal but skillful Vladislovas may take him as his subordinate. This likely had crossed Vladislovas' mind, seeing how he had chosen to spare Hayraven's life until then.{nl}But Hayraven shook away the thought. He began to collect himself as he shot his opponent a hidden smirk.
QUEST_20180418_008675	Again, he charged unto Vladislovas, stubbornly delivering the same attacks he knew were in vain.{nl}Vladislovas grew bored of toying with the young Hayraven. It would be the sharpened blade instead of the hilt striking at his throat next.
QUEST_20180418_008676	Then, Hayraven suddenly turned, drew a pistol out from its holster and pulled the trigger. The bullet lodged itself precisely in the middle of Vladislovas' forehead and his large body slowly collapsed towards Hayraven.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_008677	 The small boat, no longer able to withstand the weight of both Vladislovas and Hayraven, tilted over.
QUEST_20180418_008678	Waves splashed against the hull, and the cries of seagulls began to fill the air again.{nl}Nobody came to the surface. And the waves swept away the name of the Great Pirate.{nl}Far away from where the sea swallowed the small boat and the two pirates was a large ship.
QUEST_20180418_008679	In it, two groups of men had divided themselves between bow and stern; each busy setting up camp on their end of the boat.{nl}The men avoided looking directly at the opposite side as they worked. Their eyes were locked in another direction: the direction in which the captain of each group had departed on a small boat long before.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_008680	The ship where they stood was the last one remaining of a battle that went on for two entire days. Now, the men had been forced into a silent confrontation.
QUEST_20180418_008681	One side owned the ship; the other lost theirs, and had come aboard to continue the battle hand-to-hand.{nl}If their pact was to be honored, both sides would soon become the crew of that very ship, regardless of who had first served in it.
QUEST_20180418_008682	All had agreed that he who survived and returned to the ship would be made captain, be it Vladislovas or Hayraven. No pirate dared to defy Vladislovas, but if the young Hayraven was to kill him, the same would be true for him.
QUEST_20180418_008683	Bored of the stagnant tension, one man from Vladislovas' crew that occupied the stern of the ship decided to break the silence.{nl}It was Seadog, the 2nd navigator with a large dog tattoo drawn across his broad chest.
QUEST_20180418_008684	#N/A
QUEST_20180418_008685	Seadog did not hesitate.{nl}[I swear on the name of Jurate, that whoever attacks the other side before we arrive in Vernike Island will forever turn into ballast for the Kivotos.]{nl}Oceanid repeated Seadog's oath, followed by the men on either side of the ship.
QUEST_20180418_008686	Seadog took a glance at the sky and spoke again. [We'd better pray for a storm in the meantime. Though, with this weather...] Oceanid, a veteran of the sea himself, agreed with Seadog, though he too thought a storm to be unlikely.
QUEST_20180418_008687	[With the men we have, I don't think we can work this ship under a storm anyway. We'll barely make it to Vernike with all crew and any good weather Jurate can bless us with. We couldn't fight even if we wanted to.]
QUEST_20180418_008688	So it was.{nl}They weren't waiting for the result of the fights between their captains because they are loyal pirates.{nl}It seems like that they left for the battle to claim the title of the Great Pirate, the captain of remaining ship and crews. But it wasn't.
QUEST_20180418_008689	Mens of two crews could just heave up anchor and leave without their or opponent's captain upon one agreement.{nl}And that is their usual behavior. But the battle of the last two days had been that violent and intense.
QUEST_20180418_008690	They no longer wished to fight over whom to name their captain.{nl}If they did, they certainly knew that nothing was to be gained from that.{nl}He who returned to the ship would be made captain, be it Vladislovas or Hayraven.
QUEST_20180418_008691	If neither did, the crew would leave the waters, and a new struggle for power would surely ensue. After the ship reached Vernike or another suitable port, that is. They would first ensure that the ship could sail with half of the remaining crew, or perhaps even half of that.
QUEST_20180418_008692	#N/A
QUEST_20180418_008693	Seadog and Oceanid had fallen silent.
QUEST_20180418_008694	{nl}They stared into the horizon, avoiding each other's unpleasant gaze.{nl}Any words like
QUEST_20180418_008695	What are you looking at
QUEST_20180418_008696	could ruin everything.
QUEST_20180418_008697	The both of them wise enough not to start another conflict was a fortunate thing.{nl}It was in that moment that they heard the sound of someone climbing up the rope ladder that hung from the side of the ship.
QUEST_20180418_008698	{nl}The sparse crew meant that no one had been assigned to the lookout atop of the mast. The only way to look was to lean down from the edge of the ship, an act too risky for any of the men on board to pursue.
QUEST_20180418_008699	They had not heard the small boat approach the ship, so whoever it was who was climbing that rope ladder, he would have had to swim his way back.
QUEST_20180418_008700	The small boat was far too distant for that to seem plausible, but it was even less likely that someone else had happened to approach the ship in those waters.{nl}The men on deck focused on the sounds of the climbing stranger, until a hand emerged and gripped the edge of the gunwale.
QUEST_20180418_008701	The hand was not familiar to them, perhaps form all the blood, sun and sea that washed over it on the long way to the ship.{nl}No one offered to help.
QUEST_20180418_008702	If, by any chance, that hand belonged to the rival captain, they did not want his crew to misunderstand it as an attempted attack.
QUEST_20180418_008703	Seadog and Oceanid remained silent, focusing their attention on the edge of the ship while signaling their crews to stay still.{nl}The hand gripping the gunwale trembled as it pulled up the heavy body of the stranger, revealing his face.
QUEST_20180418_008704	Nearly unrecognizable by his subordinates were Hayraven's features, mangled by multiple wounds and sheer exhaustion.{nl}Every pirate on the ship thanked Jurate for giving them the victor they so eagerly awaited.
QUEST_20180418_008705	Hayraven climbed over the gunwale and stood on the deck, looking at the men on each side of the ship before addressing them.{nl}[I grant you all permission to board my ship.]
QUEST_20180418_008706	He spoke as if he had been alone on the ship waiting for the others to board.{nl}That may not have been the case, but to sailors of all kinds, boarding permission was an important convention.{nl}It was also a sign that all of the crews' problems had been solved, as no man had any intentions to defy his authority.{nl}Knowing this, Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[The captain's cabin...]
QUEST_20180418_008707	Hayraven collapsed onto the deck before he could finish his sentence, and the pirates around him hurried to help.{nl}Old and new members of his crew laid the unconscious Hayraven down in the captain's cabin.
QUEST_20180418_008708	Hayraven's Unofficial Chronicles Part 2
QUEST_20180418_008709	Warm sunlight was shining through the window of the captain's cabin. Hayraven, opening his eyes, awoke from his shallow sleep. He had dreamt another of his many recurring dreams.{nl}At times finding himself on a small boat, facing an unfamiliar foe, or at others recalling events from his past. He would dream of endless rope ladders and ghost ships. Visions of his crew and Vladislovas' subordinates populated his subconscious; dreams that shifted but remained unchanged as well.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_008710	He put on his clothes and stepped out onto the deck, where he was greeted by his crew. Hayraven raised his hand in response as he walked, but was halted by the sight of Seadog approaching. 
QUEST_20180418_008711	The latter looked up at the watchman stationed atop of the mast.{nl}Before Seadog could speak, the watchman cried out,{nl}[Mast sighted starboard!]{nl}Unaware of the fact that he would have been punished had his warning arrived only a second later, the watchman continued to shout.
QUEST_20180418_008712	[Merchant vessel! Flag unidentified!]{nl}He soon followed with more information.{nl}[Flag confirmed! It's a Kedora Alliance vessel!]{nl}Hayraven nodded at Seadog, who understood his orders.
QUEST_20180418_008713	The captain, having spotted the approaching vessel long before the watchman, sat down on a deckchair and quietly observed his crew prepare for battle under Seadog's command. The merchant ship was now close enough for all the men on board to see. Seadog, who was standing next to the captain, muttered in surprise,{nl}[Huh. Who do we have here?]
QUEST_20180418_008714	Hayraven's eyes were also set on the group of heavily armed men on deck of the neighboring vessel.{nl}[Looks like Guerra's Pledge of the Blade mercenaries are on board.]{nl}Seadog spoke carefully.
QUEST_20180418_008715	[They don't seem to be shipping any cargo. If all they have are mercenaries, their ship will be light and fast. Seems to me like they should be counting on that to retreat as fast as they can now... Unlike the Golden Note mercenaries, they don't look like they travel with enough combat supplies, either.]
QUEST_20180418_008716	[Running away would taint their reputation; that can't be good for business. No, they're looking for a fight here. Let's grant their wish,] Hayraven concluded. [Do you reckon Guerra's involved?]{nl}[It doesn't look like he is, Captain.]{nl}Seadog shot another glance at the watchman, confirming the absence of any new reports. Hayraven spoke again.{nl}[Look at the way they're lined up. They're expecting hand-to-hand. They think I'm going to fight them their way, do they?]
QUEST_20180418_008717	[The Pledge of the Blade is known for the knives, but they should know their arrows, too.]{nl}Hayraven took Seadog's words lightly.{nl}[We're pirates; we start our fights from the ship, and if we can, we end them from the ship. Why let it escalate? It's not like we're fighting the Great Pirate Vladislovas now, is it?"{nl}Seadog acquiesced and began calling out the captain's orders to the crew in a sonorous voice.
QUEST_20180418_008718	Hayraven returned to his deckchair. The early stages of the battle were easy for Hayraven's side. The wind blew in the direction of the enemy, protecting his ship from the merchant vessel's arrows and allowing his crew to decimate a large part of the mercenary forces.
QUEST_20180418_008719	Yet, no strangers to the projectile attack themselves, the Pledge of the Blade used wide shields to defend their crews.{nl}However, they were at sea.{nl}If anyone had the knowledge to make the most of the factors at play, it was hayraven.
QUEST_20180418_008720	By controlling the movement of his own ship from its fortunate position, he made use of the wind and currents to tilt the enemy vessel to a nearly 45 degrees angle.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_008721	Not only were they now standing on a slope, the mercenaries had to maintain their balance over the continuous rocking of the waves, which to less seasoned sailors was no easy task.{nl}Once the Pledge's numbers were sufficiently reduced, hand-on-hand combat began.{nl}Seadog coarsely shouted the order at the pirates.{nl}[Hook them! Hook the Ship!]
QUEST_20180418_008722	Hayraven's subordinates hurried to swing their hooks into the enemy vessel. The mercenaries, in turn, bustled to and fro, cutting off the ropes attached to the priates' metal hooks using large two-handed swords.
QUEST_20180418_008723	Observing the mercenaries' fast response to his attack, Hayraven stood up from the deckchair.{nl}[They aren't playing, are they?]{nl}He ran to the edge of the ship and swung his own iron hook at the merchant vessel, striking an unknown mercenary across the chest. The hook went on to bury itself deep within the ship.
QUEST_20180418_008724	Another member of the Pledge ran towards Hayraven's hook brandishing his bayonet. Seeing him,{nl}the captain withdrew his pistol and aimed.{nl}One shot was all it took to blast away the mercenary.
QUEST_20180418_008725	Yet already another one was attempting to reach the hook. This time, the mercenary avoided the pistol shot, causing Hayraven to react with a smile of amusement.{nl}[Alright, this one knows what he's doing. Let's see you cut this, then!] As he spoke, Hayraven swung another hook at the enemy ship, one which the agile mercenary was unable to avoid.
QUEST_20180418_008726	Struggling to free himself from the hook, the man bore deep injuries as Hayraven pulled him through the waters between the two vessels.
QUEST_20180418_008727	The Keel hauling eventually took his life before the captain could pull him up onto the pirate ship.{nl}The two crafts drew closer and closer, and hayraven eagerly reached for the Jolly Roger.
QUEST_20180418_008728	[Did Vladislovas ever hit a hip with the Jolly Roger from this far?] he asked, grinning blithely.{nl}Seadog, who had been standing by the captain awaiting new orders, shook his head.{nl}[At this distance? Impossible.]
QUEST_20180418_008729	Hayraven replied.{nl}[That's right. For anyone else it is.]{nl}With this, he launched the pirate flag across the waters.Seeing the Jolly Roger lodge itself in the merchant ship, Hayraven called out to his crew.
QUEST_20180418_008730	[Go! Let them fear my flag! I'm giving twice the loot to the first pirate to slaughter a mercenary by the Jolly Roger!]{nl}Seadog followed with his own commands.{nl}[You heard the captain. The last man to get on that ship is riding the keel.]
QUEST_20180418_008731	The pirates dutifully complied, echoing each other's battle cries as they crossed over onto the merchant ship.{nl}The Pledge of the Blade were already behind their opponents in both number and morale, and having Hayraven himself join the combat only asserted their inevitable defeat.
QUEST_20180418_008732	The Pirate Captain's dust devil quickly spread terror among the last surviving members of the mercenary group, who promptly abandoned their weapons and surrendered.{nl}It wasn't long before Hayraven's subordinates executed the few who had dared to resist them.
QUEST_20180418_008733	Finally, the captain and crew of the merchant ship, who had been hiding in a corner of the vessel as the battle was held, were dragged out onto the deck.{nl}These sailors had been spared by the mere efficiency of Hayraven's powerful attacks.{nl}Had the conflict spread out across the entire ship, they were unlikely to have survived.
QUEST_20180418_008734	The pirate looked down at the captured crew before addressing them.{nl}[Are these all the men you have? I didn't think there'd be so few of you.]{nl}Their captain replied.{nl}[It is as Guerra requested, yes. The Alliance crew was reduced and the work was assigned to his mercenaries to decrease costs.
QUEST_20180418_008735	Not only was the ship mostly occupied by these mercenaries, we are also carrying a considerable amount of our own cargo. It was very difficult for us to sail in these conditions, you see. Guerra's men aren't familiar with the sea; I suppose that ultimately led to their defeat today.]
QUEST_20180418_008736	[According to your logs, the goods you're shipping are heavy but they aren't worth much. And you say you cut the freight charges, too. It sure doesn't sound like a good deal for the alliance.]{nl}[Before our encounter, Captain, the mercenaries were paying their passage as stipulated in the contract, tending to the weapons and cleaning the deck. As for the goods, they may not be worth much now, but surely you're aware of how we do business at the Kedora Merchant Alliance. The original value of those goods will pose no problem. That is why...]
QUEST_20180418_008737	The captain of the merchant vessel stood up to adopt a bolder stance.{nl}[Should you release this ship, the crew and all of our merchandise in safety, I propose to write you a certificate. A document that guarantees you a generous fee from any branch of the Kedora Alliance.
QUEST_20180418_008738	Our goods won't yield much profit to an untrained merchant. And as you see, our current personnel are far too scarce to be any help to you. Our only condition is that this ship arrives safely at its destination. Once that is confirmed, you're welcome to claim your reward.]
QUEST_20180418_008739	[So you're offering me a paper that's worth more than this ship, the cargo and a few crewmen. Is that right? And all I have to do is wait for you to dock and tell the Alliance to get my money?]{nl}[That is correct. I should say, our communication network is rather advanced; it won't take long for the information to reach all our branches.'
QUEST_20180418_008740	Hayraven pondered for a moment.{nl}[Alright. The Alliance always finds a way to avoid a loss, don't they? Dirtier than pirates, you are. Then, the rest of the filthy mercenaries will stay with us, yes? Everything they had on them, too.]
QUEST_20180418_008741	The captain of the Kedora Alliance knew Hayraven was not asking for consent, and so he nodded in agreement.{nl}The surviving mercenaries and their belongings were moved to the pirate ship.
QUEST_20180418_008742	Oceanid approached Hayraven and asked,{nl}[Should we get the plank ready?]{nl}It was the custom in pirate ships to force captured enemies onto a plank laid on the side of the vessel and demand that they choose between joining the crew and drowning at sea.
QUEST_20180418_008743	Hayraven, however, shook his head.{nl}[Leave them be. I have a deal with Olfas Grimm. We'll gather a few more prisoners and sell them off to the Monk Master. Let them starve until they're weak enough, but not so much that they'll mutiny.]
QUEST_20180418_008744	The captain's orders were confusing, but Oceanid acceded and returned to the crew.
QUEST_20180418_008745	Hayraven was left to mutter to himself.{nl}[Guerra, you filthy rat. I hope you find me after this; maybe then I'll finally get myself a worthy fight.
QUEST_20180418_008746	This time we’ll use our knives. Hmm. Come to think of it, they do say Creak is a match for Guerra. Who knows, it could be fun to fight Creak, too. Bore a bullet hole in his skull like I did to Vladislovas. He’s not bad with his gun either, or so they say.]
QUEST_20180418_008747	At the end of his train of thought, Hayraven became silent. He raised his eyes to the silhouette of the merchant ship slowly disappearing in the horizon before turning back to the captain's cabin.
QUEST_20180418_008748	Golden Note - War Journal Vol.1
QUEST_20180418_008749	* Golden Note - War Journal Vol.1
QUEST_20180418_008750	Warsis Creek, Schwarzer Reiter Master and leader of the Golden Note mercenaries, was tending to his weapon in the barracks when the voice of a subordinate called his attention.{nl}[You have a guest.]{nl}[Let them in.]{nl}His partner Paul's features were akin to those of a large gorilla, though his wit was anything but dim.
QUEST_20180418_008751	The fact that he had chosen not to deal with the client's request himself meant that there was a problem.{nl}An issue with the contract, perhaps. Or a client too important not to be seen directly by him...
QUEST_20180418_008752	{nl}[Our guest has just arrived from the Polanyi territories.]{nl}[Pleased to meet you. My name is Yiltren, representative of the Polanyi territories.]{nl}Warsis stood up to greet him. Yiltrin returned the formal bow and prepared to address the Master.
QUEST_20180418_008753	Warsis figured that being forced to repeat what he had likely just told Paul all over again would at least bother him, but the man's expression remained calm and composed. Either his problem was urgent, or he was used to that kind of situation. His posture gave away no signs of restlessness, so Warsis concluded it was the latter.
QUEST_20180418_008754	[The former Duke of Polanyi divided the territories into three portions, which he passed on to each of his sons. Our land is now smaller and no longer united, but the three lords have always lived in relative harmony.
QUEST_20180418_008755	That is, until recently, when the eldest brother passed away with no heir of his own, and the land was once again divided. Each lord now owns part of their brother's land, but neither can agree on how to share it. It has gotten to the point where they're resorting to the use of force.]
QUEST_20180418_008756	The dispute itself was obvious to Warsis, but he was left wondering.{nl}[I understand that they would resist dividing the land in half out of greed, but any official diplomat of the Kingdom can certainly intervene. How did the situation escalate without the say of the government?]
QUEST_20180418_008757	[Official powers do intervene when there is a dispute between two noble families. The ministry will send officers to investigate and determine who is right, then take the measures necessary to enforce their decision. Unfortunately that is not the protocol for conflicts arising within nobles of the same family.
QUEST_20180418_008758	The ministry will not interfere unless a member of the family is suspected of a very grave crime, such as practicing cruel tyranny against the people of their land, colluding with the demons, or otherwise violating the sanctity of the goddess' divine grace.
QUEST_20180418_008759	As it is, matters concerning the sovereignty of a territory are the sole responsibility of the ruling lord or lords.]{nl}[Even if that's true, I do think an official diplomat should be able to issue a corrective order...]
QUEST_20180418_008760	[Well, yes, but it would take a serious infraction of the royal law in order for them to take any measures. There's never been a corrective order issued about territorial disputes. In fact, there's hardly ever been a situation considered grave enough to warrant a corrective order.
QUEST_20180418_008761	It simply cannot be done without a serious motive.]{nl}[I suppose they never punished any lords for misjudging their own governing abilities or famishing entire regions...]{nl}[Precisely. Incompetence does not justify the punishment of someone in the noble class. When the people disagree with their lord's decisions, they find a cleric to complain to, or they petition to the ministry in the capital. Otherwise, they simply live at the whims of their ruler, for better or for worse.]
QUEST_20180418_008762	[So your case is considered an internal issue and can't be solved through diplomatic action.]{nl}[Not only that, but since there is no heir, the residents prefer that one of the former Duke's remaining sons is made lord, rather than an administrative officer from the capital.
QUEST_20180418_008763	As you know, if a lord passes with no legitimate heir or has their noble title revoked as punishment, an officer of the Kingdom is assigned to manage the territory.{nl}That opens the possibility for another noble person to gain ownership of the land.
QUEST_20180418_008764	In any case, an administrative officer, as fair and benevolent as they may be, will only stay as long as their mandate. There is no telling what influence that might have on the region.
QUEST_20180418_008765	A long-term ruler is the better option, particularly considering that our former Duke is still very much revered by his people.]{nl}[Well, any lord can only rule because there is the law of the Kingdom above them. And with it, clerics that commune with the goddesses and interpret Their will.
QUEST_20180418_008766	The only difference, which you also mention, is that a lord can rule the same territory for longer. That is what keeps local government stable and consistent. I wouldn't say it's because lords are more competent than royal officers.]
QUEST_20180418_008767	[I very much agree. Our problem is that the land was divided in three not long after it was first united. The residents agree on a reunification, but the ministry has left the issue in the hands of the current rulers.]
QUEST_20180418_008768	[In all honesty, you should be thankful that they've given you power over this situation. So, are the two lords preparing for battle?]{nl}[No, sir. That is not what they want. But settling this dispute through words alone has proven impossible, which is why I came to request your help. Isn't this the kind of work you do, after all?]
QUEST_20180418_008769	[Hm, I see. They can't use their own people for battle. Any casualties and the royal officers will come knocking. Talking it out isn't going to work either, so they're looking to hire mercenaries to fight for them instead.
QUEST_20180418_008770	If that's all there is, was there a need to bring the client to me directly instead of accepting the order and reporting on it as usual? Paul?]{nl}The words were harsh in Paul's ears, but Warsis was used to relegating general requests to his partner and did not hesitate to scold him.
QUEST_20180418_008771	Paul's answer was simple.{nl}[The other side is employing the Pledge of the Blade, sir.]{nl}[Hah. So you thought I'd be scared of facing Guerra? Or do you just take pleasure in hearing a client say it to my face?
QUEST_20180418_008772	Doesn't matter. It's not every day you get the chance to stand against an expert like Guerra. We'll take the request. You can settle the details of the contract with my partner Paul.]{nl}Warsis directed a short bow towards their client, before turning around with a pleased smile.{nl}[This is going to be interesting.]
QUEST_20180418_008773	Golden Note - War Journal Vol. 2
QUEST_20180418_008774	* Golden Note - War Journal Vol. 2
QUEST_20180418_008775	[This is not your call, General!]{nl}Schwarzer Reiter Master Warsis Creek raised his voice to the man facing him across the table. They were inside his barracks, sitting opposite each other on worn out wooden stools.{nl}[I'm afraid it is.]
QUEST_20180418_008776	The reply came from Lamin, a general of the Royal Army.{nl}[How?? Territorial disputes are under the jurisdiction of the ministry. Their officer Beikeol already declared that the problem is to be settled by the two parties, in consideration of the residents and the former Duke.
QUEST_20180418_008777	I'm well aware of the conditions. No damage to any property in the region, and no casualties on either side of the local armed forces.
QUEST_20180418_008778	So I have to insist: this is not the place for the Royal Army. Think about it. Your superiors won't be happy to hear you're interfering in a civilian dispute; that will only escalate the problem. Not to mention how it will look to His Majesty the King.]
QUEST_20180418_008779	[We have no intentions of defying the authority of royal officers or ministries. The same is true for the Royal Guard, our Royal Knights, and every other general of the Kingdom.]{nl}[Why is it that having you, General, say this in front of me only makes you sound less credible?]
QUEST_20180418_008780	[My men and I are officially off duty. In the meantime, we were given orders to search for territories around the Kingdom that can be used for military purposes.
QUEST_20180418_008781	This area of land has just lost its owner and it could be very useful to us. Naturally, we want it.{nl}Whether the ruling lords are at battle, or whether they hire mercenaries to fight for them is not of our concern.{nl}Territorial disputes aside, we are here to adapt this region for military use. That is our official stance.]{nl}Warsis Creek pondered on the general's words before replying.
QUEST_20180418_008782	[That's the army's position. Now I want to hear your personal opinion, General Lhamin.]{nl}[Yes, to be honest, if it weren't for this dispute we wouldn't have come here under the pretext of using this land for the army.]{nl}Lhamin paused for a moment before speaking again.{nl}[Mr. Creek.]
QUEST_20180418_008783	Intrigued to hear the general call out his name, the Schwarzer Reiter Master adjusted his position, leaning lower towards the table.{nl}Lhamin waited until he was sure he had Warsis' undivided attention.
QUEST_20180418_008784	[I'll be frank with you. I know I'm overstepping my authority coming here. I know I have no right to stand in the way of official orders, but I was not sent here by my superiors. I'm keeping an eye on Olfas Grimm and Aleister Crowley. I'm also worried that something might provoke the folks in the Astral Tower to launch an attack.
QUEST_20180418_008785	Those are all real threats to the safety of the Kingdom.{nl}But the Royal Army isn't allowed to take action without sufficient reason. And we can't give away the fact that we're paying attention to these issues. Only when something happens can we intervene.]
QUEST_20180418_008786	[Well, isn't it your duty as general of the Royal Army? Following the orders of your superiors and the Royal Court when trouble happens?]{nl}[Need I remind you that you abandoned a bright career as general of the Kingdom to pursue your own military endeavors, Mr. Creek? If anyone should sympathize with my position, I would expect that to be you.]
QUEST_20180418_008787	[So you believe that waiting until the Court commands you to act is more damaging to the Kingdom, and you can't stand waiting in the dark. So you'll do whatever it takes to prevent something serious from happening, as long as it's not strictly against royal law.]
QUEST_20180418_008788	[Correct. I believe it's my duty as general of the Kingdom to use any resources at my disposal to protect the nation and its people.]{nl}[Good. I agree with you, General. Although I don't think I would describe my military career as "bright". Yours, on the other hand...]
QUEST_20180418_008789	[I'm afraid there are many talented and more experienced generals above me, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Come on, General, there's no need to be humble. Tell me what you want.]
QUEST_20180418_008790	[Ministry officer Beikeol is a very intelligent man and an outstanding bureaucrat. Some even say he's set to become the next Premier Eminent.
QUEST_20180418_008791	But something about his behavior changed in the past few years. It's not enough to incriminate him, but it has caught my attention. Like this territorial dispute, for example. The locals who remember the original Duke want their land to be ruled by either one of his remaining sons.
QUEST_20180418_008792	The officer agreed to let the two lords settle things on their own, so long as the conflict doesn't escalate too far. This all seems fairly reasonable, until you consider...]{nl}[... that the scale of this whole confrontation wouldn't be nearly as serious if the lords hadn't hired the Pledge of the Blade and the Golden Note to fight in their behalf. Regardless of the outcome, the responsibility is ours and the residents'.
QUEST_20180418_008793	Do you think the officer was trying to aggravate the conflict? There's no proof of it, of course, but is that your suspicion?]{nl}[Incisive as always, Mr. Creek. Not only is there no proof of the officer's intentions, but his reasoning is almost undeniably correct.
QUEST_20180418_008794	Also, I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that two Class Masters and two rival mercenary groups are involved.]{nl}[I can see why. Now, this isn't entirely related, but I'm curious about your work with the Astral Tower and the other Masters. I understand you're paying close attention to them.]
QUEST_20180418_008795	[As a Master yourself, you know that Class Masters are treated like nobility even if they aren't of the noble class. After all, it's an important position one gains by having their talent recognized. The problem is when one of those highly talented people uses their skill or authority for personal reasons.
QUEST_20180418_008796	I simply think that Masters who show that disposition should be monitored.]{nl}[There are much more despicable people among our Class Masters. Corsair Master Hayraven, for example.]{nl}[It was His Majesty, King Rowmel who assigned high positions to pirate captains of the time to increase the numbers of the Royal Navy, and gave them the symbolic token that is passed on from Master to Master. It was an unfortunate decision that we should be trying to rectify.
QUEST_20180418_008797	It isn't right for us to continue allowing the pirates to use their contributions of eight centuries ago as an excuse to maintain their importance and appoint their own Masters.]{nl}[Revoking their right to the royal token is nearly impossible now.
QUEST_20180418_008798	The token was always taken from the previous Master through means of skill, and His Majesty, King Kadumel declared 600 years ago that the position of Class Master is to be merited by skill. No king has been able to invalidate the token after that, and now it's in Hayraven's hands.
QUEST_20180418_008799	Whether we like it or not, the token proves that he is recognized by the Kingdom.]{nl}[King Kadumel's legacy isn't the brightest, unfortunately.]{nl}[Any reasonable person will agree, but that's not what we need to focus on.]{nl}[How I regret not being able to handle Hayraven myself.]
QUEST_20180418_008800	[And you say you're worried about the Astral Tower? That's unexpected. The Schaffenstar have been strong allies of the Kingdom for centuries, and Mechen doesn't seem all that bad.]{nl}[Yes, I very much admire their long tradition and dedication. Their leader Mcen is also exceptionally talented and good-natured.
QUEST_20180418_008801	 However, the Schaffenstar are more numerous than ever and they're incredibly skilled. Not only that, they have autonomous rights. They may follow the values of their founder Lydia Schaffen now, but there's no guarantee that that will always be the case.
QUEST_20180418_008802	From a military point of view, if the Schaffenstar were to declare themselves as an independent territory with the Starlit Lake as their borders, there is little the Kingdom could do about it. "There is no such thing as an impenetrable fortress, and even the strongest ones are destined to fail without consistent support from the outside"...]
QUEST_20180418_008803	[Glkahn Donihue, The Theory of War Vol. 3.]{nl}Lamin looked almost serene as he nodded knowingly at Warsis. The general continued.
QUEST_20180418_008804	[Unlike what the great General Donihue believed, however, impenetrable fortresses do exist. The Astral Tower is proof of that. It transcends theory, really. The only possible way to conquer it would be to wait for all the Schaffenstar members to grow too old to sustain the tower.
QUEST_20180418_008805	Not even if a miracle of the goddesses brought back all the great generals of King Zachariel would there be another way to bring it down by force.]
QUEST_20180418_008806	[The way I see it, all it takes is an act of treason to weaken the entire foundation of a society like them.]{nl}[Yes, historically it wouldn't be the first time it has happened. The problem is that there isn't much else we can hope for in terms of a solution. As general of the Royal Army, I simply cannot be at ease knowing that an organization like this has the power to ignore our royal laws if they want to.]
QUEST_20180418_008807	[I understand, but let's not worry about things that haven't happened yet. We have our own problem to solve now, remember? What are you going to do about our dispute?]{nl}[From what I've observed, it seems like both you and Mr. Guerra aren't quite sure about what to do next.
QUEST_20180418_008808	You already settled your commission with the lords. Financially, you can't afford to drag the dispute for much longer. You fought a few battles with no sure victory, but scaling up the conflict means an even heavier burden on your funds.
QUEST_20180418_008809	Maybe it isn't my place to say this to the leader of a mercenary group, but if you've been fighting for this long with nothing but casualties and injuries to compensate for, isn't it time to agree on a cease-fire? Isn't that also part of your work?]
QUEST_20180418_008810	[I do not need you to explain my job to me. I understand very well that this situation needs to end if we're going make a profit from it. Guerra isn't the only one with an eye for money. Do you think I would be the leader of a mercenary group if I didn't know how to do business?]
QUEST_20180418_008811	[Very well. My request is simple, then. Leave. I know you need to return to the capital soon, to complete your contract with the arena and take in new men from their group of fighters. Surely you're not planning to miss that? You would be wasting the amount you spent on the deposit, not to mention the opportunity to integrate new mercenaries.
QUEST_20180418_008812	It's very important that you leave now. You may lose the bonus for retreating without a victory, but I'm sure you'll have agreed on a fair commission either way. And yes, you can count on extra compensation if you stay and win, but if your side is defeated, won't that result in twice the losses?
QUEST_20180418_008813	 That is why you need to leave now. Take the path of less risk and abandon this conflict immediately.]{nl}[Financially, yes, that is the most sensible solution. But still...]{nl}[My soldiers and I will occupy the entire area where your mercenaries are located.  The Pledge of the Blade won't be able to attack us.
QUEST_20180418_008814	 It's hard to imagine anyone defying the Royal Army. In fact, my soldiers and I would be happy if they tried. We would very much like the chance to face off against Guerra's men. It isn't something that happens every day, after all.]
QUEST_20180418_008815	[Would that be legally viable?]{nl}[We'll use force and pressure them to abandon their occupied territory. The ministry or the army will likely send someone to investigate. They'll go back and forth before they make the decision to send me the orders to retreat, but that will take time.
QUEST_20180418_008816	I'll receive a warning for misinterpreting the scope of my duty; nothing serious. If I'm lucky, my superior in the capital, General Vincentas, might even recognize this land for official military use.
QUEST_20180418_008817	 If that happens, the two lords who hired you will just have to accept the situation. Of course, with the ministry in charge, things might not look good for me.
QUEST_20180418_008818	Prince Tylenis and Princess Kaonilla both have ties with some of my general friends in the Royal Army, so I don't believe they would let me get demoted over this incident. At most, I'm expecting a cut in my pay or some other kind of mild disciplinary action.]
QUEST_20180418_008819	[If you're already expecting that, why not go ahead and propose an expropriation of the disputed territory? Even if one of the lords ends up occupying the land, the profit from the crops can help fund the soldiers stationed in the area. It can't get more practical than that.]
QUEST_20180418_008820	[That's a good idea. We would never be able to do that in reality, but the absurd proposal is sure to make the two lords rethink their positions. If we can create a new plan to section the land, there's a chance they will consider it one final time.]
QUEST_20180418_008821	[I think Guerra should handle the agreement, in that case. I will already be gone by then, and Guerra can use his influence to settle the dispute and receive some added compensation from both lords.]
QUEST_20180418_008822	[Are you sure you're rivals? Hahah. That's incredibly generous of you, Mr. Creek.]{nl}[Let's keep it at that. I'll give my men orders to begin evacuating. But I'll need to you to make sure that both my mercenaries and the local soldiers are protected from Guerra's side while I'm away.]

QUEST_20180418_009038	#N/A
QUEST_20180418_009039	The Origin of Nicopolis{nl}- Year 1096 of the Kingdom,{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009040	The year 15 of the reign of King Baltinel, the 14th King, was a time where the vigor of the founding of the Kingdom was weak and conflicts between factions reached their peak.{nl}This was during the years 348 and 363, about 700 years ago.{nl}Although he was unable to settle the conflict, he is known for laying down the foundation for the Royal army.{nl}If one considers that the rules of King Jeromel's time kept the Kingdom in order, then one could also agree that King Baltinel's use of the Royal Army was another, equal approach to the problems.{nl}This new military approach was helpful in solving the issues of King Baltinel and of his predecessors.{nl}Yet during the reign of King Jusel, after the conflicts between political factions had been settled, a new approach was needed for dealing with the other problems that still remained.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009041	 Of these, the most serious issue to deal with was the Wizards.{nl}During this time, the Wizards had organized themselves into an alliance and compelled others to join.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009042	 Joining the union also meant following a strict set of rules. As a result, the Wizard society of this time was divided into union members and non-union members.{nl}And if compared, those of the union were stronger than those who were not.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009043	 There were worries that the the Clerics and other warriors who bore the strength of the goddesses would be overpowered or, if that was not the case, the union Wizards would overtake the country.{nl}If the organized Wizards were simply stronger and nothing more, then these rumors would not spread, but there were a small few within the union who clearly wished to use this strength for power.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009044	 On the other hand, there were Wizards who are either hermits or research-focused and act alone, separate from the union.{nl}As such, although those of the union did not seek for world domination, most of the Wizard societies' initiatives and proposals naturally went in favor of the union.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009045	 Concerns were raised about what would happen to the Wizard society if the union was left unattended.{nl}Although the concerns were few, it was those with wisdom who brought the issue before the Kingdom, thus marking it as a crisis.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009046	 Thus began King Jusel's official support of non-union Wizards.{nl}Through official policies, his government provided financial support for their research and livelihood.{nl}In retaliation, union Wizards sold their magic at a more expensive price, making it harder for mercenaries and others to gather funds.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009047	 Yet those who were not part of the union were mostly researchers and hermits, while those who were part of the union more actively and systematically sold their products to the noble families. This allowed them to build a wider circle of connections.{nl}As such, King Jusel could not prevent the contracts and transactions that occurred between his Kingdom's subjects.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009048	 However, there were more complicated measures, such as adding a new tax regulation to cut into the union's profits and to move the non-union members into friendlier relationships with the royal family while slowly reducing the amount of union shops.{nl}Through these methods the government and the nobles were forced to invite non-union members and as a result the measures were thought to be a success.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009049	 As these events unfolded, the union members were able to protest, but it had reached a point where even that had become difficult.{nl}There was nothing more for them to do except to retaliate.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009050	 There were those who did not like that the work had been passed on to non-union Wizards, but if the situation resulted in a rebellion they were more than likely to side with the royal family. And they would have to deal with Clerics, who had the power of the Goddesses with them and the royal families and their soldiers. Along with that, it is possible that many members would leave the order.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009051	 More importantly, there was no pretext for a rebellion.{nl}But the alliance did not stop there, and instead thought of a different method.{nl}They demanded an independent self-governing domain within the borders of the Kingdom.{nl}If they could not be leaders of the world, they would at least make the brightest city known to man.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009052	 Although their intentions were inpractical, King Jusel had no way of preventing their request.{nl}As this was legally similar to the lands that the noble families ruled on their own.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009053	 The alliance through various means gathered the funds necessary to purchase a plot of land. When their representative went before the Royal family to register as leader, the Royal family, taking comfort in the fact that if a situation should arise then only those in that domain would feel its effects, accepted.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009054	 The alliance gave their new city the name Nicopolis.{nl}It wasn't long before Nicopolis saw success.{nl}As they were all gathered in one place, their efficiency saw new heights and they were able to produce magic scrolls and items that produced better effects at a cheaper cost.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009055	 The Royal family were also pleased by the successes of Nicopolis and funds from the tax increased.{nl}And with this change, they no longer had the burden of supporting the non-alliance members.{nl}If the Wizards of Nicopolis kept to themselves, then all would be well and prosperous.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009056	 But as we already know, this is not how things played out.{nl}To this day, the events of Nicopolis are still unknown, but the Wizards of the city were known to dabble in unprecedented magic. The side effects of which caused not only the alliance Wizards but all the citizens of Nicopolis to disappear.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009057	 One hypothesis is that their disappearance was the result of a failed attempt to enhance their magic to its highest potential. As the side effect had no impact on the buildings of the city, we will not be able to know what exactly they were and where are those who were affected.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009058	 The city was deserted, yet despite the passing of time the buildings of the city showed no signs of decay, remaining the same as the time it was built. All because of the magic that encased it.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009059	 Later, as fear of the city slowly began to disappear, it was used by migrating citizens of the Kingdom and remained a fairly normal city until Medzio Diena.{nl}But the magic of the city became a burden to the citizens when the calamity that was Medzio Diena struck.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009060	 It's still not known as to why, but compared to Fedimian and other cities, Nicopolis faced the most damage, causing those who lived there to desert the city in considerable numbers.{nl}After Medzio Diena, most citizens of the Kingdom fled to safer lands, yet it is said that there are still some who remained to make use of the more advanced equipment of the city.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009061	 According to rumors, monsters have now gathered at the city and it's recommend that those who have no place being there, should avoid it.
QUEST_20180418_009062	 * Legend of the Mausoleum{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009063	 The source of this document is currently unknown, as it was only recently uncovered. The original material on which it was written may look like paper, but it behaves very differently from any common type of paper, a trait which continues to baffle bibliographers to this day.
QUEST_20180418_009064	 I personally suspect that this document may originate from Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009065	 I am certain that this document – and, by extension, records of it – did not exist before Medzio Diena. If it is true that Medzio Diena affected not only our world but the Fantasy Library as well, it is my theory that a Revelator may have entered the Library, causing some of its contents to cross over to our world as consequence.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009066	 Unfortunately, the excerpt transcribed below is the only section of the document that has been recovered so far. We can only hope that its remaining parts will one day surface.{nl}- Year 1096 of the Kingdom{nl}Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009067	 Enveloped in the familiar chill of the stones, Duke Kamof passed through the gateway. After all the workers had been sent away by order of the king, the room felt even cooler.{nl}The absence of humidity, if anything, confirmed to him that the structure had been built as intended.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009068	 The mausoleum needed to remain free of humidity to avoid damaging its inner constructions. No one knew how many eras the structure would have to last, which meant that every detail required the utmost attention.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009069	 With these thoughts crossing his mind, the duke hurried his step towards the floor below, where his lord awaited him.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009070	 His lord was a man who had earned the honorable title of Great King after unifying the lands of the Kingdom. His name was Zachariel, but it had been years since anyone had called him by that monicker.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009071	 Of course, no one would ever doubt that even a king has a proper name, just as no one would ever dare to call one by that name.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009072	 To Kamof, who had known Zachariel from the times when he was only a landlord, the name now sounded unfamiliar.{nl}A couple more steps and the duke found himself in a room with the king and a few of his loyal subjects. Noticing him, King Zachariel greeted the duke with a wide smile.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009073	 [It pleases me to know that the construction of the mausoleum is going as planned. Thank you for your efforts, Kamof.]{nl}The duke replied.{nl}[Your Majesty. The mausoleum remains unfinished. It's far too soon to send away the workers.]{nl}[I was under the impression that only this floor had been cleared.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009074	 [There is still work to be done here as well.]{nl}[I don't believe the work that needs to be done from now on is something we want outsiders to know.]{nl}[But Your Majesty. All the writings at the plateau were also carved by simple workers at Your Majesty's command. This is no different.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009075	 [The men who carved the stones may have committed no crime, but the fact remains that we erased their memories by force. We mustn't allow demons or anyone with evil intentions to covet our legacy. But I also do not wish to betray my own people in such ways ever again.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009076	 Determined to convince the king, Duke Kamof looked around at the other men standing by Zachariel.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009077	 Senior vassal Nbetgeller had served the king longer than anyone in the room. Commander Jupert Killen was in charge of overseeing all military operations. And there was general Glkahn Donihue, the king's personal guard. None of them offered to help support Kamof's argument.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009078	  Duke Denonn Sherivic, the highest aristocrat in the judicial field, was the first to speak.{nl}[I say, if His Majesty is willing to take a hammer and chisel in his own hands, who are we to refuse? I understand it is your duty to ensure the efficiency of this construction, but remember, there are much more important things to consider now.]{nl}Kamof was quick to reply.{nl}[Did I ever refuse to work for His Majesty? What I am saying is that those who have been tasked with governing the nation ought to do just that. Forgoing that work for a stonemasonry project seems awfully out of place.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009079	 Sherivic did not back down.{nl}[It's all been explained by His Majesty. We may not know every detail about why this mausoleum was built, but certainly you know it isn't a mere whim of His Majesty's.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009080	 You know this structure is a provision for a catastrophe that will threaten our Kingdom and humanity itself. If not us, who do you suggest handles such an important task?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009081	 It was then that Glkahn Donihue, the man responsible for the king's personal protection, first intervened.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009082	 [You are both correct. Your Majesty. The Royal Knights can complete this task under the command of our major general, if Your Majesty allows. The Royal Guard will not disclose any information concerning the mausoleum. As it happens, the men that arrived today with our major general are some of our most reliable.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009083	 The reply came from senior vassal Nbetgeller, who until then had remained silent.{nl}[I understand His Majesty's intentions to protect the secret of the mausoleum. However, the men in this room are our court's highest representatives. I see no reason to mistrust them.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009084	 We must find a way to complete the task at hand without burdening the workers, nor ourselves.]{nl}[Is that possible, I ask?]{nl}At Zachariel's question, Nbetgeller explained,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009085	 [In my opinion, even if we are to complete the task through our own efforts, it's only right that we continue performing at least some of our governing duties. That is why...]{nl}[Yes?], Zachariel urged him.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009086	 [First, Your Majesty must allow us to use magic. Second, for the stone carvings, in lieu of hammers and chisels, we can make use of acids and chemicals to erode the stones.]{nl}[Magic and chemicals, you say. Isn't that dangerous?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009087	 The old vassal knew what Zachariel meant with his short question, and he did not hesitate to answer.{nl}[All we need to do is handle the chemicals carefully. As for the magic, I don't believe it will affect the mausoleum's visitors in the future.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009088	 Your Majesty worries that our magic could someday be traced by a skilled wizard, leading them to the mausoleum and exposing our legacy to the world before the time is right. I understand that.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009089	 But Your Majesty, in time, skin that is burned with natural fire scars no different from skin that is burned with magic.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009090	 Any methods we use to carve our writings and symbols onto these stones will be simply that: methods. Your Majesty need not worry about them.]{nl}King Zachariel, seemingly convinced by the vassal's words, said, [Hm, is it feasible?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009091	 [We can use General Donihue's soldiers to carry out the task and continue to focus on our original duties. The work at the plateau is complete. According to Duke Kamof's report, the mausoleum now requires only the final details. I would say the task is perfectly feasible.]{nl}[Very well. That is what we shall do.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009092	 [Thank you, Your Majesty. But, if Your Majesty allows, I would like to pose a question.]{nl}[What is it?]{nl}[As far as I could tell, this mausoleum was built not for Your Majesty's eternal sleep, but for someone who is meant to visit it in the future.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009093	 Every inner working constitutes a test to that person's skill and intelligence, not to mention the safety provisions keeping the mausoleum from being approached by enemies and thieves. And yet, the work Your Majesty has entrusted upon us now seems to contradict that purpose entirely.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009094	 [You are right to assume what this mausoleum is for. However, my purpose isn't simply to test those who may come for the goddess' Revelation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009095	 You see, I wish to leave a gift for the visitor who completes the trials of this mausoleum. The path awaiting the one who finally enters these chambers will be unimaginably strenuous. My purpose is to leave for them a token of my appreciation, as well as a valuable message.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009096	 Who knows? To them it may be nothing but the preachings of a man who is long dead, but that is my wish.]{nl}Hearing this, Nbetgeller smiled as he prepared to address the king again.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009097	 [Your Majesty's knowledge is that of our founding monarchs. Your Majesty's teachings will not be in vain. In fact, may I suggest that this chamber be named after that?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009098	 [Something like 'Hall of Knowledge', perhaps? I must say, it sounds rather awkward but it isn't so bad.]{nl}Nbetgeller added, [One cannot tell how much time will pass before the destined visitor finds their way to Your Majesty's blessed mausoleum.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009099	 I believe it is only right to pass onto our visitor as much knowledge as Your Majesty is willing to, regardless of the value that knowledge may hold in the future.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009100	 [That is what I intend to do. I shall document everything that is allowed to me about deities and demons, the foundation and history of our Kingdom, and the will of the goddesses in the planning and construction of this mausoleum.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009101	 I wish, if it is possible, that all of this is left here in this Royal Mausoleum. And if there is still space, I wish to leave my own memoir.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009102	 The King said these words with an air of confidence. His vassals bowed their heads in reverence not simply because he sat in a seat of power, but because he represented a piece of the Goddess' divine providence.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009103	 Note: After discussing the matter with Cyrenia Odell, it appears that the record above about the Royal Mausoleum does not properly represent the legacy of the King.{nl}Due to this, I have done additional research and have concluded the following possiblities:{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009104	 First, there is no truth behind these documents.{nl}I, through basic reasoning, have ruled out this possibility.{nl}Two, the Royal Mausoleum was opened and through certain means the legacy of King Zachariel has been corrupted or damaged.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009105	 And finally, three, the most likely possibility is that the real legacy of King Zachariel resides in the Great Woodlands in the mysterious mausoleum.{nl}Which means, for some particular reason, the King did not leave his legacy in his own mausoleum while at the same time requesting that his predecessors keep the second one a secret.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009106	 If this is true, then it is now difficult for us now to know if the legacy matches with their respective kings in their appropriate tombs.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009107	 As the location of the mausoleum in Great Woodlands has not been confirmed, it is still difficult to conclude as to why the King and those who came after him, made such a decision.{nl}

QUEST_20180418_009109	*Encyclopedia of Masters, Chapter 3{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009110	 The Masters of this edition have held their positions for years and are relatively well known.{nl}As such, I was able to write without help as I did for the last edition.{nl}However, as always, one Master writing about others of the same era can lead to unnecessary misunderstandings and drama.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009111	 Nevertheless, I feel that without a written record, especially in this time where certain calamities, such as Medzio Diena, can cause us to forget to document our history, we will be unable to hand down our records to those of the next generation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009112	 Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009113	 1. Swordsman Master Rashua{nl} Born as a commoner, Rashua rose from the lowest rank in the army to that of general.{nl}He has held the position of guard captain of the Royal family and even when he became a general he continued to oversee the training of new recruits. Because of this, he became quite well-known.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009114	Although he has been formally discharged from service, he temporarily returned to interview new soldiers. Yet following the events of Medzio Diena there are rumors that he has returned to duty.{nl}In truth, Rashua had stepped down from heading military training, but at the request of the army it is said he has returned, although only he would know the full details.{nl}In a famous turn of events, after receiving the position again after Highlander Master Douglas Black, it was once again given to General Lamin.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009115	 Besides this famous occurrence, not much can be spoken of in relation to the rest of his work, as the circumstances of it are closely kept military secrets.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009116	 2. Peltasta Master Maria Leed Master{nl}Maria Leed is a particularly special character.{nl}Unlike her peers, she has no direct connection with the army.{nl}This would imply that she was a hired hand, but this too isn't quite the case.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009117	 One can still be classified as a Master, with a preference to work alone and without being involved in either field. But this will result in fewer followers.{nl}She and the few that do follow her act as mercenaries and can be employed for a price, yet this is not their main focus.{nl}Because of her unique character and the interesting nature of her followers, she may continue to reject the Highlander Master's calls for a partnership.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009118	 3. Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn{nl}Abreh Melinn is an atypical Wizard who has been able to find an effective fusion between faith in the goddesses and magic research.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009119	 Her exceptional achievement in magic is thanks to a blessing from Goddess Gabija, which also allowed her to reach previously unknown heights in fire magic.{nl}In her glory days, it is said that even Agailla Flurry's fire magic was no match for Abreh Melinn's burning flame.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009120	 4. Wizard Master Lucia{nl}Born from a common background with average ability, it is said that Lucia was lacking in talent when first started out as a magic apprentice.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009121	 However, with an iron will, she overcame her shortcomings and rose to the rank of Wizard. She uses her own experiences to help fledgling magic students.{nl}An avid supporter of magic, she disapproves of those who do not take their training seriously and who think lightly of the Wizard's path.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009122	 5. Cleric Master Rozalija.{nl}Rozalija used her talents as a cleric and healer to help those in Klaipeda, Siauliai, and other such places. Because of this, despite her young age, she has received love and affection from many of the Kingdom's citizens.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009123	
QUEST_20180418_009124	 6. Krivis Master Herkus{nl}Of all the Clerics, the Krivis are the most traditional followers of the Goddesses.{nl}As serious followers of tradition and times passed, many older Clerics can be found here. However, there are a few Clerics who wish to follow traditional practices of Goddess worship in their early studies.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009125	 Followers of this path must not waver and must lead a life of faith.{nl}Luckily, Herkus has an affinity for teaching this strict devotion along with the grace of the goddesses to the people due to his years of experience as a Krivis priest.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009126	He is also good friends with the Paladin Master.{nl}Their friendship is the background for the close relationship the two orders now share.{nl}This is the type of relationship many wish they continue to foster despite their differences in the past.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009127	 7. Archer Master Edmundas Tiller{nl}Edmundas Tiller is a distant descendent of a royal family that fell to the rank of commoner after falling on hard times.{nl}Coming from a family of farmers he entered the army and later became a Master.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009128	 Due to his past, he takes a particular interest in sponsoring talented people coming from unfortunate circumstances. He is also interested in the construction of the Astral Tower.{nl}Acquiring the materials necessary for repairing the walls of the city is also an important task of his as he hopes to fortify Klaipeda's defenses.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009129	 8. Quarrel Shooter Master Ream Toiler{nl}Before Medzio Diena, Ream Toiler had a number of hobbies such as upgrading his armor and catapults while also studying the traditions of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009130	 It's said that he is also the type to gain weight easily.{nl}Although he sincerely works hard, the reason for this hefty appearance is due to his nature of equally balancing his duties as Master and his personal hobbies.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009131	 No one can deny his impressive call to action after the events of Medzio Diena.{nl}Yet there are still many who spread unfounded rumors that he is has bragged to Hunter Master, Fiona Ieva, about a sudden weight loss.
QUEST_20180418_009132	 * Ancient Affairs:{nl}Concerning Boruta{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009133	 Five deities had gathered together.{nl}From the moment She had arrived until now, Goddess Austeja complained.{nl}[This is all wrong.]{nl}Goddess Medeina responded.{nl}[This is a decision made by both Ausrine and Giltine.]{nl}[But it was really Giltine who had decided and Ausrine simply gave in.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009134	 It was clear from her expression that Goddess Medeina acknowledged Austeja's rebuttal.{nl}[That may be true, but it has already been decided. At this point, it's irreversible.]{nl}[Yes, I admit that, but tell me you do not think destroying another dimension is allowed? We could have prevented that place from connecting.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009135	 [That would not be to Giltine's liking. Even Ausrine believed that sealing travel between the dimensions would be incomplete...]{nl}It was at this moment a voice like static cut through, disturbing the two goddesses' conversation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009136	 [This is entertaining. Aren't you a little obsessed with those humans? You are doing this for them, keeping their futures safe by getting rid of these dangerous beasts. I'm surprised you're this dissatisfied, Austeja.]{nl} Austeja turned to face the one who spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009137	 [Look, Baubas, you are so very annoying for someone who has lived as long as you. Our work for the humans and this are two different things. And this work from the Creator to protect the humans is not just our task but yours as well.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009138	 [Hahaha and that is why I am here with you, is it not? Who knows what Giltine would rather do, but I for one would rather destroy it than seal it. And to completely collapse a dimension, you'll need someone as great as Giltine. Without that, you'll need an impossible amount of force.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009139	 Ragana, who was standing next to Baubas, looked up at the sky as though weighing something, and then spoke.{nl}[Soon, Giltine and her minions will be done dealing with the other world. It would seem that in a bit, the remaining survivors will try to escape to this end...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009140	 Up until this point, the silent Goddess Zemyna muttered something under her breath.{nl}[While it may be true that compared to our world this other dimension is quite small, but would she really be able to finish everything this quickly? Even if it's Giltine...]{nl}Baubas heard this and replied.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009141	 [The plan is not to face them one-on-one, but rather to change their world into something akin to a hell. That too would be difficult, but if she succeeds then they won't be able to stay there.]{nl}[To change their home is horrible.]{nl}This too Zemyna muttered to herself, yet it prompted a response from Baubas.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009142	 [The structuring of that world is different and is not made from the sort of earth that you control. Giltine could be making use of that difference. She did take the Froster Lord with her so, who knows, it might become an ice hell.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009143	 [If that is true, then ice would kill most of them or at least cause them to flee towards us. Either way, they are headed towards death.]{nl}Ragana added.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009144	 [There is a chance that the very strongest of them will neither die nor live and instead be completely frozen.]{nl}Medeina added her own guesswork.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009145	 Goddess Austeja let out a sigh and spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case may be they are also living things. Yes, they are a danger to our world, but if it was at all possible simply locking them up would have been better...{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009146	 The Creator has told us to protect this world and the humans, but did not instruct us on how to do so. It was Giltine who decided to take such measures and they are ones that I cannot agree with.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009147	 [Well, consider what was said before. Those monsters may go into hibernation. That's almost the same as shackling them. We can just catch the ones that escape and, if you really want, you don't have to kill them. If you wish to seal them up I won't stand in your way.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009148	 But I don't know if you have the power to do so by yourself, Austeja. If you were planning to wait here, then you can also consider helping us get rid of the beasts that are coming this way.]{nl}Baubas said.
QUEST_20180418_009149	 It was then that Goddess Medeina spoke.{nl}[We're lucky that they have not accidentally left their world to roam here. And the ones that will come will be few. Because of this only five or so of us need to wait for those who escape...]
QUEST_20180418_009150	 Goddess Zemyna replied to her sister.{nl}[That is correct for now, but if the energy of the Divine Tree continues to spread this world will become fit for those beasts and even more will arrive. Making this task harder.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009151	 Right now it does not matter as the humans will be protected. But still, more of those beasts will encroach upon this world to cause problems. Now is the best time to protect them from such beasts.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009152	 The energy of the Creator's Divine Tree is spreading slowly but it is as yet not a barren world.]{nl}Baubas for an indiscernible reason chuckled and said.{nl}[There are those of you who think well.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009153	 Austeja seemed to show a bit of resentment towards this.{nl}[We always think the correct way. You and your friends follow the Creator's wishes and yet think you are acting on your own. This is especially true of Giltine.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009154	 As though provoked, Ragana spoke next.{nl}[Well then, has Ausrine even once accomplished bringing you as all together as a team?]{nl}[There was never a time where it was necessary. As we concentrate on our own work we are able to complete the Creator's wishes.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009155	 [So like that you are all doing your work well, even Laima? When she receives prophecies and controls fortunes, what is she doing? Is there nothing to fix? Or do you know and would rather not share it with us? Is that it?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009156	 [Is there a sister who does not know of the persecution Laima faces from knowing the future? You know of this too, don't you, Ragana? Receiving these powers from the Creator is not something that we can play with. Furthermore, it is a power that one cannot use for one's own ambition.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009157	 [So you're saying that Giltine wants the power handed down from the Creator for herself?]{nl}[That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying that Giltine is using it as justification for her to have her way and overreacting by destroying a whole dimension...]{nl}At this, Ragana interrupted Austeja.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009158	 [You may argue the pros and cons of Giltine but since the eternal sleep of the Creator, the truth is, we have not seen a greater leader than Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009159	 This is a task that Ausrine has also supported. To round up and kill those beasts so that the world and the humans you love have a future. It's clear that these circumstances are unavoidable despite it not being to your or Ausrine's liking.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009160	 But it is here that Baubas and I have come to provide help, however, make it known that we do so not for the humans.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009161	 At Ragana's words Austeja and she made eye contact. There was nothing logical that Austeja could say in retort and rather than denouncing Giltine she decided to avoid further conflict by averting her eyes.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009162	 And that was when Medeina spoke.{nl}[We are responsible. Although we have our differences, we cannot continue to quarrel. Are we not here for the sake of this world? And more importantly, the very beasts we have been waiting for will soon make an appearance.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009163	 In that moment, in the air, black dots appeared.{nl}These beasts, bearing wings, were falling out of the sky.{nl}As an effect of their unintentional and haphazard dimensional travel, they were unable to use their wings despite their efforts.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009164	 There were a few who were able to unfurl their wings, yet rather than fly they tried to their best to glide themselves into a soft landing.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009165	 Goddess Medeina spoke the words,{nl}[They cannot be left alone,]{nl} and reaching out her hand she summoned countless arrows of light to swarm upwards and into the blue sky.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009166	 As the first of the beasts to adapt had yet to collect themselves, the arrows hit their mark perfectly. If they had not, the beasts would have landed where the five deities were waiting. Instead, they were thrown off their mark and fell elsewhere nearby.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009167	 Baubas saw this and spoke to Goddess Zemyna.{nl}[When they hit the ground use that earth power of yours to trap them. It'll be annoying if they fly off.]{nl}She replied.{nl}[That's fine, but I'll need some time to properly bind them.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009168	 Ragana responded.{nl}[Is that necessary? If we kill them all, it'll be fine. That's all the time we will need.]{nl}But Baubas had other thoughts.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009169	 [It will be pointless if they escape. Let us go with the original plan. Ensure that not one of them flies free. Austeja can stay out of the fight and instead protect Zemyna until she completes the ceremony. That way you two won't have to get your hands dirty...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009170	 When Baubas said this the two goddesses agreed to the task.{nl}In a matter of seconds, in the distant sky, more dots appeared that caught the god's eyes. It was more of the beasts.{nl}Later, in legends, these monsters would be known to humans as dragons.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009171	 Medeina once again sent a score of arrows into the air.{nl}The vast majority of these dragons who had come to this world to escape the onslaught from Giltine crashed to the ground. The impact killing many, while those who were still hanging on were in no better condition.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009172	 Regardless, there were some who did not die from the impact and were able to avoid Medeina's attack.{nl}However, despite their efforts to glide to safety, these remaining dragons were unable to control their drift and crashed into the ground.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009173	 As a result, there was not one dragon who reached the ground unscathed.{nl}Baubas looked about him and said.{nl}[If I had known that these would be the only ones to arrive, I could have handled this on my own.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009174	 To everyone's surprise, it was not the goddesses who responded, but Ragana.{nl}[If you were alone, more of them would have survived and Zemyna too would not be here to tie them up.]{nl}[Everyone lent a hand, you know.]{nl}[It's just there were not as many here as Laima foresaw...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009175	 [Meaning you do not trust in her predictions...]{nl}Having already expressed those feelings to Ragana privately, Baubas turned his attention back to the battlefield,{nl} where there still remained a dragon on the brink of death.{nl}[Well look at that. Leave him to me. You all can clean up the rest.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009176	 Without waiting for a response, he set out to fight the beast.{nl}Medeina let out a sigh, and Ragana watched briefly as Baubas walked away, before they both set about on their own task of checking for survivors.{nl}It was work that involved ensuring that the dead dragons really were dead.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009177	 As Baubas approached his target, he began to hear the dragon.{nl}It was not through voice, but it was possible for them to communicate.{nl}[You with the wicked smell, who are you? You devils have destroyed our home forcing us to come here. What possible reason could you have to commit such a crime?]{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009178	 Baubas replied with a sneer as an answer to the question.{nl}However, this proved ineffective as the dragon had no knowledge of the demon gods and goddesses of this world and thus disregarded the expression.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009179	 However, as their minds were in tune with each other Baubas was able to convey the meaning behind the gesture.{nl}[You have a lot of questions. But it will be difficult to tell you my name in your language. I believe the same will hold true for you as well.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009180	 Regardless, if I am to answer you, although I do not know how it will be received, my name is Baubas. Your name from ancient times would be Boruta in our language.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009181	 And as a sign of kindness, to answer your other question, it is because your kind has wandered that extinction became necessary. I don't know about Austeja, but it means nothing to me. I mean that I do not care about justifying myself to such creatures.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009182	 To think of you as something that has intelligence and should be respected, it is quite annoying. I see you as something I can release my anger upon. As I cannot fight my fellow gods and humans are much too weak.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009183	 [Huh? Our kind? Humans? What do you mean?]{nl}[At that's right. You had no interest in knowing about this world or what type of beings live here, but suddenly you would appear and devour what was here, am I not right? Because of that sort of stupid attitude, it's obvious as to why you are where you are today.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009184	 If there weren't so many of you I would have finished you all off myself, but Giltine being both wiser and stronger has more efficiently rounded you up as so. And seeing how it turned out, even Austeja would agree.]{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009185	 [Cease! No matter what you say it is because of you that our kind has been slaughtered. This world's concerns mean nothing to us. To avoid the predictor you have started your destiny with this game.]{nl}[That is true, but you do not know the subject of the matter.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009186	 With that said, Baubas went into action.{nl}Baubas launched an attack on Boruta's back.{nl}Boruta believed he could stop the blow but it proved futile.{nl}It was because his speed was quicker and his attacks sharper than those of dragons.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009187	 It was the first time in Boruta's life to feel such pain. He was just barely able to block the second attack with his claw.{nl}At least, so he thought.{nl}He did in fact block the blow but as a consequence his claw fractured.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009188	 His claw, unlike its back, would be able to heal in a matter of moments, but Baubas used this moment of weakness to attack at Boruta's back again.{nl}With the claw destroyed, Baubas could have easily attacked another location, such as the wings, but instead decided to aim for the torso, clearly not giving the battle his all.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009189	 [At this rate my full strength, let alone a weapon, will not be necessary...]{nl}It was here that Boruta came to realize the embarrassing truth. In a one-to-one fight against Baubas, he would be unable to win.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009190	 Baubas had also mentioned in passing that if there were not so many and the fight was fair, there would be a chance he would win.{nl}It was exactly because of this strength and number that they have lived so peacefully in their own world for so many years.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009191	 Even after discovering this other world, these beasts were so involved in themselves that they did not concern themselves with the beings this world calls gods.{nl}But the price of this ignorance was costly.{nl}They were massacred and before Boruta stood his own death.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009192	 Boruta unfurled his right wing, successfully whipping Baubas away. As Baubas came in for another attack, Boruta was able to send him flying again.{nl}Now that the strength in his wings had returned, he planned to rise.{nl}Yet his intention was not to flee but to attack from a better position.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009193	 But in the next moment, the realization came to him. He was unable to take flight.{nl}Although Boruta was unable to identify Baubas' expression, Baubas was overcome with satisfaction watching Boruta's moment of failure.{nl}This time around, he sprung towards the dragon, directing a blow to his head.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009194	 The pain of such blows to his torso and head where unknown to Boruta.{nl}It was because an attack had never drilled through his leather hide.{nl}Of course, this does not mean that in their world, when fights broke out there was an absence of dragons who suffered such damaging blows.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009195	 There were those who yowled after facing such an attack, while there were others with worse damages who kept their mouths firmly shut.{nl}As Boruta was always on the winning end, this level of pain was one he had yet to experience.{nl}But now in this strange world from a strange being he was being taught how much his body could endure and the distressing truth that he wasn't as strong as he thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009196	 Seen another way, one could believe that the dragon was simply unlucky.{nl}No matter the situation, he could not win.{nl}As such he must run.{nl}As he could not fly, his only means of escape was to carry his wounded body on foot.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009197	 Yet, following behind the dragon was a carefree and smiling Baubas.{nl}Although Boruta was running, he was still easily overcome by the Demon God Baubas' casual pace.{nl}Because of his wounds and the superior power of Baubas, Boruta was no longer in a situation where he could escape.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009198	 At that moment, without a sound, Austeja appeared at Baubas' side.{nl}Even though he had only heard the sound of wings, Baubas was aware of Her arrival.{nl}As he turned his head towards Her, She spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009199	 [Let him be.]{nl}[Haha sorry but you cannot just ask to have things your way. Why? Why should I let him go?]{nl}[He might be the last of the dragons...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009200	 [That may be true but, there may still be survivors in their own world as well. Not just here, but how are we to know there aren't survivors in the other places.]{nl}[Yes but, at least here there are none.]{nl}[So we save him and then he'll kill the humans? That beast may not know their strength, but without effort he could easily devour them all.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009201	 [We can hide him somewhere underground. That way, Zemyna, who reigns over the earth, will be aware of his location. We just have to seal him so he doesn't escape. If we seal him deep within the earth, without the strength of Zemyna nor the Creator, no one will be able to free it. Even for Ausrine and Giltine it will be difficult.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009202	 [This type of attitude suits you. Fine. If that's what you want, let's do it. But I'm curious about two things.]{nl}[And that would be?]{nl}[No, three things. When will I get to hear your begging again? When will I get to see you fight? And when will Boruta again be released? These three things I'm curious about.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009203	 [All three are impossible.]{nl}Austeja's expression hardened in response.{nl}[Huh, don't joke too much. You never know when the time will come again when you will need another favor from me. Or when we too will have to fight. Whether the Creator awakens or that power engulfs the world again.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009204	 [If you want payment for saving it...]{nl}[And I want that now. I enjoy killing but I hate the cleanup. Yet someone needs to deal with these dragon carcasses. I see this duty fit for you to thank me for all that I've done.]{nl} Like this, Baubas spoke and before Austeja could respond, he departed.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009205	 But it wasn't the leftover work that Baubas had pushed upon Her that stayed with Her. It was the gloomy foreboding thought that {nl}'whatever occurs, Laima knows all.'{nl}Her eyes fell upon the body of the dragon before Her and She began Her work.
QUEST_20180418_009206	 * Herrmun-Madale{nl}River Crossing Incident Vol. 1{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009207	 Fifty one days had passed since the death of King Zachariel.{nl}He had died at the age of 51 and it was his son, Jeromel, who received the title of Lord. He now sat on the throne with his head in his hands.{nl}Over twenty lords and the royal family congregated together at the palace to commiserate the passing. They were well aware of the dilemma the king was facing, but since no one wanted to be the first to bring up the topic, they waited in silence.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009208	 It was Licsion, brother to the King, who finally spoke.{nl}[There is nothing more to say. We will command them to cease on the King's orders. If they do not listen, we may then use military force. Whoever you send, shall not be defeated. On your command, any one of us will go.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009209	 [But if this suggestion is followed, the peace we have had for 40 years will be broken. And in history, our king would be recorded as the one who was inaugurated and then went to war. He would be known as the king who was unable to keep the peace his ancestors had restored.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009210	 These words came from the next in line to the throne, the crown prince. Another member of the royal family spoke next.{nl}[Let us use a royal order to evict them. If needed we can extend their territories. Rather than punishing them for insubordination, pursuing disciplinary action would be more justifiable.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009211	 Another member spoke.{nl}[If we command them to cease their fighting and they do not listen, will they then listen to us as we command them to change their dominion? There is a high possibility that they will ignore us and we will have no choice but to mobilize the troops.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009212	 The King will have no choice but to see this as a mutiny. This will also destroy the peace our previous kings have fought for since the founding of this Kingdom. This too will result in a revolt.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009213	 The first member to speak, spoke again.{nl}[Who here does not know this? In any case, is there no better reason than this to use the army? And if a war begins, their lack of military strategy will be their downfall.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009214	 Their troops may be greater, but they will not have the help of the wizards and the goddesses' priests. Those families may have confidence in their fighting abilities but they will ultimately be at a disadvantage.]{nl}Although he spoke as such, his confidence did not match the tone of his words.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009215	 The issue facing the nobles and the royal families was as follows.{nl}The Herrmun Family and the Madale family were currently the two strongest nobilities in the Kingdom.{nl}And as luck would have it, they shared neighboring territories.
QUEST_20180418_009216	 Just like typical neighbors, they could not coexist in peace and, although during the 40-year reign of King Zachariel the two families did not publicly show their displeasure, it was inevitable that their hostility would erupt into conflict.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009217	 As the ruling power of the Kingdom was passing hands for the second time, the pressure placed upon the noble families was lessened, thus giving the two ambitious families an opportunity they could not overlook.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009218	 It was not in defiance of the Kingdom, but thinking that there would be no other opportunity before them, they took action. Thus believing that if a result could be determined, then the royal family would have no choice to but accept.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009219	 And as both families were headed by those who felt confident in their military prowess, they believed that this was the only way forward.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009220	 On one hand, in the early days ascension disputes were settled with the Kingdom's military, but if the new King's ascension to power was indeed disputed the moment the previous King had passed away, this displeasure would have been known.{nl}There was not one person who wanted to go against the royal family nor who sided with the feuding nobles.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009221	 As such, they would not receive help from the priests and the wizards thus, objectively, it would result in a win for the throne. However, the two families' boasting of military prowess is not an overstatement.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009222	 In any case, one side would win and one would lose. If the king's army was to appear,  the two noble families would deal with these soldiers first. If this was the case and they advanced even one step the situation could become uncontrollable.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009223	 The royal family's authority to rule would be questioned as the army would be criticized for its weakness. If news spread to the nobles who swear allegiance to the throne the foundation of the Kingdom would be shaken.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009224	 However, thanks to the goddesses the unified Kingdom would remain and the priests, through the goddesses, would keep the Kingdom safe. But the royal presence would be but a memory as nobles from all regions chose to do as they like. And the royal name would be ignored as the country falls into chaos.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009225	 There were no instances in history that could be referenced, but King Jeromel and those who were gathered here knew that the foundation of the Kingdom was not on the monarch but on a change lead forth by the second monarch.{nl}Again, a silence lingered until finally, Duke Greeo, the eldest of the nobles who gathered here, spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009226	 [From what I know, currently the Royal Army has 24,000 troops. And when the previous King had checked, the total number of troops that could be mobilized in the case of an emergency was estimated at 170,000. If you choose to limit the number of guards in each city, you will be able to mobilize more.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009227	 If the Duke of Herrmun mobilizes his troops, they will be about 12,000 strong. Duke Madale would be 8,000. Therefore, together about 20,000 troops. If both sides slander their fortunes and hire the maximum amount of mercenaries while also mobilizing another nobles' of whom they are close with, the total could be doubled to 40,000.]{nl}[Why are you suddenly doing such calculations?]{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009228	 [If we use 24,000 troops from the king's army against these 40,000 troops we will be using military force, but if we only send 4,000 it would not appear as such. This will not be enough to stop a war or to take disciplinary action. But, it is more than enough to be used as escorts for a representative of the royal family.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009229	 A silence followed after Greeo's words and King Jeromel was the first to break it.{nl}[If the rank of this representative is high enough that would be an acceptable amount of troops. For example, if it was a king, correct?] His brother, Licsion, shared a thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009230	 [But we are not saying that Your Majesty should be the one to go. But if these troops did not escort a king, then it would be excessive.]{nl}The first to speak of such an idea, Duke Greeo, spoke again.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009231	 [This is why the crown prince must be the one to go. With this we can properly assess the situation while also showing that we take such issues seriously and present a dignified appearance.]{nl}Licsion heard this and was quick to reply.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009232	 [This would be a good chance to bestow onto the crown prince His Majesty's title. He would then be Jeromel II.{nl}Like this, we can take care of things under the king's title.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009233	 By the authority of the king, he will receive this title and complete the work set before him.{nl}This will also secure the next line of succession.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009234	 Another member of the family spoke.{nl}[Sending the crown prince with an imperial authority will carry more weight. Like this, he can address the situation directly and deal with whatever problems that may occur. I see no problem with this.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009235	 However, I'm curious as to how Duke Greeo came to the conclusion of 4,000 troops. if your decision is not to appear strong, then why not 3,000 or why not more, such as 5,000? My intention is not to shine doubt on this, but rather for us to collectively discern the correct number of troops that we need to send.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009236	 And this, Duke Greeo replied.{nl}[Because if necessary, we may need to use military force. 4,000 may not be able to repress the opposition, but they will easily be able to join together with other forces if necessary.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009237	 I previously calculated that there would be 40,000 troops. But in truth, they may be less than that. If we take into account that our opponent cannot use priests or wizards, then in truth the number of troops could be two times less.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009238	 Now the question of where to get such troops could not be avoided.{nl}But before it was raised, the Duke answered.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009239	 [We will request troops from the Kingdom's noble families. I, of course, will be the first to gather my troops. Although we cannot predict how many will answer the call, I believe we can gather 40,000.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009240	 4,000 is one-tenth of 40,000, which is a decent number to go with the crown prince. And 40,000 will match the number of both sides' men. We will be able to defeat them with this amount and we can use the priests and wizards if the situation calls for it.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009241	 The crown prince will try to persuade both sides and if that fails we can use military force. If it comes to this, it will not only be the royal family in attendance but all of the Kingdom's noble families as well. It will become a situation that justifies dispatching the soldiers.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009242	 King Jeromel opened his mouth to speak again.{nl}[Not much time has passed since my ascension to the throne and already my title has been changed from Jeromel to Jeromel I. This is good. If none oppose this decision, it will be accepted.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009243	 Operational plans and military decisions will be headed by the crown prince, while reports will be made to me.]{nl}There was no one in the palace who opposed the decision and for the time being this was their response to the situation.
QUEST_20180418_009244	 Below is a popular lore scholars believe was written during the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}Various records of the adventures of Taokaka exist, but it is safe to believe the story documented here is closest to the original.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009245	 - Sage Master Lufas Kehel{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009246	 * The Adventures of Taokaka{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009247	 One day, on a secluded path, Taokaka came across a demon.{nl}Since he was a polite boy regardless of the situation he decided to address the demon himself.{nl}This was also not the first time for Taokaka to come across such danger and as such he was already experienced in such things.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009248	 [Hello, what are you doing?]{nl}[I'm spinning the wheel of destiny.]{nl}The demon answered curtly.{nl}There was, in fact, a spinning wheel before the demon.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009249	 [A wheel? And why are you spinning it?]{nl}[This is the wheel of destiny. By spinning the wheel one can take away what another has and give to them what they did not. The fruits of these trades are within the wheel. Spinning the wheel again will randomly give one to the owner.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009250	 [That sounds nice.]{nl}[Maybe not. The wheel will return to the target something they hold dear, something they have forgotten, but what it will give to the owner cannot be surmised.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009251	 And if you're the owner of the wheel, you must spin it seven times. Whatever escapes on the seventh spin, must be accepted.]{nl}[Where are you at now?]{nl}[Six.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009252	 [Then will you spin it again?]{nl}[Only if you agree to accept it.]{nl}[And if I don't?]{nl}[Then I will kill you.]{nl}[Well, it seems I have no choice.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009253	 [Yes. I have killed those before you who rejected me. If you fear death, then don't delay and accept this magic wheel. Accept it and I will leave with whatever gift the wheel grants me.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009254	 All this time I have carefully chosen who to spin the wheel for and now only good remains within it. Now if I spin the wheel, it will take something cherished from you, and give something for you and something for me. This also means that whatever you receive won't be bad.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009255	 Of course, if this wasn't the seventh rotation, then there is no need for two gifts to appear. It always takes one and gives one.]{nl}[Alright. Well spin the wheel, then give it to me.]{nl}The demon, with a mixed sense of freedom and accomplishment, spun the spinning wheel one last time.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009256	 Both the demon and Taokaka knew that the wheel took something from Taokaka, but what it was they did not know.{nl}The demon saw this and spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009257	 [It must be something abstract like a feeling. That's why it can't be seen. If it was something like intelligence or courage, you would suddenly become stupid or filled with fear. Since that's not the case, at the moment, whatever it is can't be known.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009258	 As the demon said that, something from the wheel entered him.{nl}It could not be seen, but what it was could easily be known.{nl}The demon's appearance changed into something more sinister.{nl}Whoever saw could tell that the demon had obtained additional strength.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009259	 He gave a sinister, demonic smile and spoke.{nl}[I have obtained unbelievable strength. With this, in the demon realm I can win the rank of Demon Lord. Endless vitality would have been more beneficial in surviving the many battles but I'm pleased with this improvement. 
QUEST_20180418_009260	 Regardless, things have turned out well. Boy, I'm leaving. Before you spin the wheel on me. Hahahaha!]{nl}With those words, the demon disappeared without a trace.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009261	 Taokaka, without a stir, simply picked up the wheel and said, [Well then wait, we will meet again...]{nl}And he continued walking.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009262	 As he walked with the wheel in hand, he was pulled towards the sound of music in the distance and followed it to an open field in the forest where a group of people was holding a masquerade.{nl}Taokaka spun the wheel and the music was absorbed.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009263	 It was because, here, music was the most precious commodity.{nl}In return, the wheel gave those at the masquerade the virtue of honesty. In that moment, they ripped off their masks and revealed to each other their true selves.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009264	 Taokaka continued on his journey once again.{nl}On the path before him was a toy knife.{nl}It was shaped like a sword, but it was a toy just bigger than the size of one's palm.{nl}Here, Taokaka spun the wheel.{nl}From the toy knife came its most precious possession, fun.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009265	 And because what the toy knife was missing was an owner, the wheel gave it one. Its new owner became Taokaka.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009266	 Now carrying both the wheel and the toy knife, Taokaka continued walking and met a person apathetically working on the soil.{nl}In front of this person, Taokaka spun the wheel. 
QUEST_20180418_009267	 From the wheel came the fun that was taken from the toy knife. With this, the bored worker suddenly realized the insurmountable excitement he could have from his work.{nl}And in return, the wheel took what was most important to him, one day's wage.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009268	 As though struck by a dream, the worker understood that he would miss one day's wage, but since tomorrow too he could enjoy his work and be paid, all was well.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009269	 And although he was not there and did not know the proceedings of where and how to deliver this wage, the worker's employer went about doing so without a second thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009270	 As Taokaka continued on his way, he passed many people and places, but if the need to spin the wheel did not come, he moved on.{nl}With that in mind, when he came across a discarded wine bottle, he spun the wheel.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009271	 The feelings of intoxication and drunkenness entered the wheel.{nl}And in return, it gave music.{nl}Now if one had the wine, one would not get drunk but rather would hear the sounds of music. And Taokaka continued on.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009272	 Time passed before Taokaka stopped before the corpse of a fallen knight.{nl}It was clear that the knight had fought to his death.{nl}Nearby was what appeared to be his sword and the signs of a struggle.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009273	 Taokaka spun the spinning wheel before the corpse.{nl}The powerful death of the fallen knight entered the wheel.{nl}And the wheel gave the corpse what the demon had spoken of before he had left, endless vitality.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009274	 When the fallen knight received the gift, he was revived.{nl}He spoke to Taokaka and gave him his thanks.{nl}From the knight, Taokaka learned that the killer was the demon from whom he had received the wheel.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009275	 And from the knight he also learned that the demon had traveled to various other places, leaving a path of destruction in his wake as he searched to obtain only the best.{nl}He learned that the knight had died in pursuit of this vile demon.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009276	 The knight said he would pursue the demon again, and Taokaka said he too was in pursuit.{nl}This is because Taokaka wanted to take back what the wheel had taken from him.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009277	 To get back what was taken someone must be the target of the spin and Taokaka believed his target must be the demon.{nl}Therefore, Taokaka and the knight set off together to find him.{nl}Since the seventh spin of the wheel must be saved for the demon, Taokaka resolved to spin the wheel once more.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009278	 After careful deliberation, Taokaka selected the toy knife and spun the wheel again.{nl}The wheel gave to the toy the death that was taken from the knight's corpse.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009279	 But what it took was its ownership. The knife was no longer Taokaka's nor was it anyone else's.{nl}Put other way, one could say the rights of ownership were taken from the toy and now belonged to the wheel.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009280	 Although the wheel had taken death from the knight's corpse, it was not the only thing that it gave the toy knife as now death itself was unclear and the knife's very concept of ownership was altered.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009281	 Regardless, now whomever touched the toy had nothing before them but their demise.{nl}As without an owner, it would become an uncontrollable knife of death.{nl}But as luck would have it, the revived knight carried within him endless vitality and as such was unable to be killed by the death pervading the knife.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009282	 And as such, the knight became its sole owner.{nl}With the knife under his control, the two set off again on their journey in pursuit of the demon.{nl}And before long, they came across the demon who had given Taokaka the wheel. The demon spoke first.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009283	 [This is quite unusual. To meet you again and even more so, to be greeted by this knight that I have already killed. How are you alive?]{nl}Taokaka replied.{nl}[That's not important.]{nl}[Then what is? Human boy.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009284	 The demon asked and Taokaka answered.{nl}[Returning to me what had left when you had spun the wheel. In other words, I want what was cut from me. Good or bad it was mine.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009285	 This sparked the demon's curiosity and he asked,{nl}[Alright, then what was it that the wheel cut?]{nl}[As my grandmother once told me, since the day I was born I received a blessing from the goddess. A blessing of luck tied to misfortune, she said.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009286	 [Luck tied to misfortune?]{nl}[Yes. The misfortune is the reason why I meet demons like you or other dangers, but because of the luck I always win. But this time, it has been cut and a part of that blessing has entered the wheel.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009287	 As soon as he heard this, the knight spoke.{nl}[Whatever the case, it seems what has entered the wheel must be luck. And since the bad luck has nowhere to go, it attached itself to someone else.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009288	 Taokaka nodded and replied.{nl}[It seems that way. This is why you have met me again.]{nl}As he said these words, he spun the spinning wheel.{nl}By then it was already too late for the demon to escape and whatever came out from the wheel was what he would have to accept.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009289	 The wheel spun, but the demon who understood the nature behind the wheel believed he still had a chance.{nl}He would gather his strength, attack Taokaka and the knight and steal the wheel again.{nl}Even if the wheel took what strength it had given, he would still have his original power which would be enough to finish the task, he thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009290	 However, the wheel did not take away from the demon the strength it had given.{nl}Instead, it took from him the misfortune that had caused him to meet Taokaka again.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009291	 This was good for the demon until the wheel rewarded him with the intoxication and drunkenness that it had taken from the wine bottle.{nl} The demon did not lose himself in his drunken state, but he had no choice but to be overcome by the feeling.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009292	 As a result, he was unable to speak and stumbled along until he fell to the ground.{nl}At this point, Taokaka felt no further need to spin the wheel.{nl}This is because the luck from the goddess' blessing had been released and rejoined with the misfortune that had left the demon, before finally being returned to Taokaka.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009293	 The fallen demon, who knew his only choice now was to use the wheel, fumbled in a drunken stupor towards Taokaka.{nl}Taokaka gently rested the wheel on the ground and stepped back. The demon, with a smile of satisfaction that only a drunkard could make, picked up the wheel.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009294	 The same smile plastered on his face, he spun the wheel.{nl}The wheel took from the demon his intoxication and rewarded him with the power of ownership.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009295	 Like that, the demon became the everlasting owner of the wheel and become unable to pass on the wheel to anyone or anything in existence.{nl}Moreover, the demon knew that the wheel had taken his intoxication but he had yet to realize what it had given him.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009296	 As the demon sat there puzzled, still considering the situation, the knight stepped forward and touched the demon with the tip of the toy's blade.{nl}As the demon's thoughts were preoccupied with other matters, he did not think twice to avoid the attack, believing the weapon to be a mere toy.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009297	 But in this knife was death and it killed the demon where he sat.{nl}And with his death also meant the death of the owner of the spinning wheel.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009298	 Although they tried, the knight and Taokaka came to realize that they could no longer spin the wheel, let alone even pick it up.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009299	 In the end, the knight and Taokaka left.{nl}And not too long afterward, Goddess Laima appeared.{nl}As there was no one in possession of the spinning wheel, Goddess Laima was now able to retrieve it with ease.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009300	 And so, with the wheel of destiny returned to the goddess who rules one's fate, Goddess Laima disappeared.{nl}And it is here where the story of Taokaka, and his bottle of wine that does not intoxicate but plays music, and the knight, with the knife that can kill all, comes to an end.
QUEST_20180418_009301	 * Chridela Otero Diaries Pt. 1{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009302	 In a small, tattered house, an old man reached out with his hand from the crude bed where he lay.{nl}Chridela took her father's hand into her own.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009303	 [I'm sorry, Chridela. It's my own fault that I wasted my noble blood only to die like this. I only regret never having done anything for you.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009304	 The girl shook her head.{nl}[Please don't say that. You have to get better.]{nl}[If only I had the fortune of your grandfather, your future would have been very different.]{nl}[I can take care of my future.]{nl}[I'm sorry.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009305	 Her father repeated the words one more time when, as if all energy had left him, he closed his eyes and fell asleep.{nl}Chridela, having skipped already two meals in a row, succumbed to hunger and fatigue as she, too, went to sleep.{nl}When she woke up, her father had already left the world.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009306	 After the humble funeral, arranged with the help of the villagers, young Chridela could do nothing but cry in her empty house. Her tears had only just dried out when she heard someone knock on the door.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009307	 Chridela didn't answer, but the door wasn't locked, and they came in through the open door.{nl}There were two of them; one was the village elder, the other was a man she didn't recognize.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009308	 The man took one look at Chridela and sighed. He said to her,{nl}[I know your father met someone like me not long ago, and I know it won't be easy hearing what I have to say to you, but...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009309	 Before he could continue, Chridela wiped her face to stare boldly at the man.{nl}[An Otero never avoids responsibility, for better or for worse. What is it that you came to tell me?]{nl}The man looked back with a hint of surprise on his face.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009310	 [You are brave for such a young girl. People used to say no one in the family was half as good as Manel Otero.]{nl}The man observed Chridela's expression, but the fact that he had just insulted her family didn't seem to bother her.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009311	 It wasn't that she didn't understand, she was only being cautious.{nl}The man was again surprised by her attitude.{nl}This time, he addressed her in a serious tone.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009312	 [Manel Otero, the founder of your family, was granted noble status under His Majesty, King Termanel, the 38th ruler of our Kingdom. By the third generation, all of your family's property, assets and valuables had been either sold or impounded.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009313	 Paintings by Sakkurrhe, the great artist of King Wardel's era, were let go at a price that doesn't nearly compare to their value. A most regretful decision, if I may say. Your father had nothing but the noble status of his name, and now he is no more.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009314	 [You don't have to tell me what I already know. You should start by telling me who you are.]{nl}[Oh! Where are my manners? I am Kdit, from the Kedora Merchant Alliance. I can't really say it's nice to meet you at a time like this.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009315	 Alas, this is how we had to meet. I'm surprised you were already aware of all of that. But there's something you need to know.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009316	 Chridela waited for the man to continue.{nl}[Your father may have been born to a noble family, but under our law, that privileged status does not last forever. The Otero family has never made significant contributions to the Kingdom. What's more, they wasted their reputation and wealth throughout the generations.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009317	 That is why your noble status has been revoked. Your family will no longer receive the benefits granted to the noble class, particularly in the fiscal sector. Perhaps fortunately, your family has no more wealth to benefit from. This house and all it contains will also become property of the Kedora Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009318	 Though it's a fortunate thing your father owes us and not another agency. We are not the type to strip a poor orphan girl of all her belongings to avoid losses. That said, we can't let you stay in this house anymore.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009319	 It's not just a matter of paying off your father's debt. You need to live with a legal guardian until you're an adult.]{nl}[A guardian?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009320	 [Or you can be sent to an orphanage run by the clerics, though I do think a guardian is your best option. You'll be sent to your ruling lord, where you'll receive work and education. Most take the chance to learn a profession they can follow as adults. If you're talented enough, there's nothing you can't learn.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009321	 The lord is required by the law to pay for your upbringing, no matter how costly. Of course, if you're looking for more than basic education, you'll have to pay it all back to the lord once you become an adult.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009322	 [So I get to live in the lord's castle?]{nl}[Not quite... Normally that is what happens, but your case is different. Someone else has volunteered to be your guardian.]{nl}[Who?]{nl}[I cannot tell you; not yet. But don't worry. Becoming an orphan's legal guardian is not only a matter of wealth or will, and we at the Kedora Alliance would never disregard the safety of a child.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009323	 Kdit paused for a moment.{nl}[You don't have to call a neighbor, we will be taking you to your guardian ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009324	 Forgive me for this remark but, financially, what we're doing here is a loss for the Kedora Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009325	 This old house and everything in it is not enough to repay your father's loan. However, we will allow you to take anything you want with you.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009326	 That includes objects you may have hidden outside the house, of course, as long as you're able to carry them. Make sure to take anything you think is necessary or important.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009327	 We won't check even if you're hiding gold bars or other valuables, so I recommend you take as many as possible. Everything you leave behind will be appropriated and reutilized by the Alliance. We will you give you a few hours to prepare. When we return, I expect you to be ready to leave.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009328	 Chridela acquiesced and Kdit gave her a short nod before exiting through the front door. The village elder quietly expressed his condolences to the girl before leaving the house.{nl}Kdit was still nearby when the elder came out.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009329	 They had promised Chridela time to prepare, so they began walking towards the village.{nl}A few steps on their way, the elder turned to Kdit.{nl}[I have to say, the Kedora Alliance is much more... generous than what I had imagined.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009330	 Kdit smiled abashedly.{nl}[There's always something to be gained in everything the Alliance does. We give when we must give, and we take when we must take. It's only a question of maintaining balance. In a way, we can afford to be generous because of how effectively we make a profit.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009331	 The village elder didn't quite agree with Kdit, but he chose not to contradict him.{nl}Instead, he said,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009332	 [I'm glad you found a guardian for Chridela. Our village doesn't have the means to look after the girl, and sending her to work for the lord would mean an entire life of menial jobs. She would probably end up in someone else's land, the poor girl...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009333	 [That doesn't sound like a bad life at all.]{nl}[Considering she comes from a noble family, I would rather she followed another path, that's all.]{nl}Silently, Kdit nodded in agreement.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009334	 In his mind, however, the Kedora Alliance official had other thoughts.{nl}'If she fails to prove herself to her guardian, she might as well marry a farmer and live a quiet life in the countryside. She may not have a choice right now, but with her attitude, there's no telling what the future of this girl will be...'
QUEST_20180418_009335	 * Chridela Otero Diaries Pt. 2{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009336	 Chridela Otero followed a man down a dark corridor.{nl}He walked one step ahead of her, his back turned to Chridela. The man's name was Frium.{nl}She had never been fond of him, so she did not try to start a conversation. It was Frium who broke their silence.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009337	 [Honestly, I've always admired you. I mean, out of the 29 boys and girls he sponsored, look at how many actually got to the level he expected. Almost none! But you... You exceeded all expectations.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009338	 At your age, the only person who can compare to you in combat is probably the Fencer Master, that Sorsha girl. And she's a Hutton; she was practically born with a sword in her hands. Considering how much you achieved in only five years, I'd say you're pretty remarkable.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009339	 Chridela couldn't stand being quiet any longer.{nl}[Even the least talented of us was still above average. It was you who set the standards too high, for no good reason.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009340	 [You think so? Our high standards weren't there to measure your achievements, you know. Dedication, loyalty... that's what we were looking for. Or at least a level of talent that could make up for the lack of those things.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009341	 To be honest, I don't really trust you. But I don't think you're a dishonest person, either. What I do know for sure is that you are a very talented woman. Frighteningly so.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009342	 [Well, you're something special yourself. For someone who can't defend himself, you're pretty brave around people who don't exactly fancy you.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009343	 [Eh, when you're running a battle arena you get used to being around fighters, murderers, all sorts of scary people. I'm just doing my job. You can't let something as irrational as fear get in the way of your dreams.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009344	 [Oh, I know. In fact, I learned that from you, Frium. You certainly don't let anything as irrational as morals or basic humanity get in your way.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009345	 [That's what I mean, you need to grow some claws. The sharper they get, the sooner you can get rid of us. Not that I expect much of you if you do.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009346	 Frium's steps came to a halt as they reached a closed door.{nl}He knocked a couple of times and, promptly, the door opened to reveal a simple room containing nothing but a crude table and a few stools, with the Monk Master sitting on one of them.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009347	 Frium waited for Chridela to enter the room and bow to the Master before silently closing the door and leaving.{nl}[Sit.]{nl}Chridela merely glanced at a stool, hesitating on the Monk Master's order.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009348	 Olfas Grimm smiled wryly.{nl}[How are you ever going to kill me with all that indecision? If you're sure about it, then take action. It's not like you're lacking in talent...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009349	 Chridela took out a stool and sat down without responding.{nl}[Are you not sure if you can kill me? Or are you still trying to hold on to your pride as an old member of the noble class? Hey?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009350	 [Enough. Why did you call me here?]{nl}[Right. Well, I was looking everywhere for a nice spot for you, but the opportunity was never there. Class Master vacancies aren't exactly easy to come by, as you know.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009351	 At the same time, I couldn't just put you into some cleric order or have you learn magic, could I? But now, now I think you might have a real chance at something.]{nl}For the first time, Chridela Otero seemed interested in the Master's words.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009352	 [Is there a Class Master retiring?]{nl}[It's the Matador Master.]{nl}Chridela was confused.{nl}[But I was never trained in Matador combat. And to be honest, I have no interest in Masters connected to the arena.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009353	 [Sure, if you're lucky there could be another empty spot, but if you let it go this could be the last vacancy you'll see in your life. You need to take the chance. Besides, someone of your caliber can learn the Matador style in no time; training won't be a problem.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009354	 Even judging by your combat skills alone, you're well within the level accepted for Masters of this field. I know you're interested in the position of Fencer Master, but Sorsha Hutton is still young, and very strong. Heck, not even a scandal could bring her down... That's why you need to take this chance.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009355	 [What about the students of the current Matador Master? You don't expect them to just accept someone out of nowhere taking their place, do you?]{nl}[Frium and I took care of that. Also, you may not know this, but people close to the Matador Master are actually fond of you. It helps that you're a good-looking woman.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009356	 As long as you show them that you're good and that you're familiar enough with the Matador techniques, that shouldn't be a problem. Come next year you'll probably be better than all of them, anyway.]{nl}Chridela didn't reply, still pondering on her decision.
QUEST_20180418_009357	 The Monk Master took one look at her and asked,{nl}[Something else on your mind? It's about me, isn't it?]{nl}[I was just thinking about the law that forbids Class Masters from carrying out personal disputes through violence.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009358	 Grimm let out a short chuckle.{nl}[Hah. I know what you're thinking. But the Matador Master is a Master of the arena. The same arena I so often visit as the combat enthusiast that I am. You'll have plenty of opportunities, kid.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009359	 But if you really want to kill me, don't you need to pay me back first? I'm pretty sure you can't do anything to me until your debt is repaid. If I remember correctly, it was that strong determination of yours that made me keep you all this time.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009360	 [Five years!]{nl}[What?]{nl}[Five years. You adopted me for five years, so that is how much I owe you. After that, you will have no right to demand anything from me.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009361	 [I beg to differ. Aren't you forgetting something? We didn't just support you with food and shelter. We trained you in the finest martial arts and made you into a capable fighter. We settled not only your personal debt, but your family's as well. Not to mention...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009362	 [Five years and three favors. That's as much as I'm willing to offer.]{nl}Chridela had raised her voice over the Monk Master's and was now looking directly at him.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009363	 Olfas Grimm was taken aback by her stare, but he quickly shrugged it off with a cackle.{nl}[Hahah. Alright. You work for us for five years. And you need to complete three missions for me. That's it, after that you're a free woman. I know you're a proud descendant of a noble family, so I trust you to keep your promise.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009364	[I will, but that doesn't mean I don't have my limits. For one, you can't force me to protect your life as my last mission.]{nl}[I'm not a fool. I'm only going to demand favors which I know you won't or can't refuse. Be it in the five years that you serve us, or in the three missions you agreed to complete.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009365	 Besides, I may avoid fighting strong people like you, but I'm no weakling myself. Do I look like a man who's afraid of death? The only reason I haven't died yet is because I have things to do. It's not because I want to live.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009366	 [You know what they say about hopeless dreams...]{nl}[You can make fun of me all you want. But the fact is that you still need to prepare for the position of Matador Master. You can start by reading these.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009367	 Grimm picked up a pile of books from behind him and dropped them on the table before leaving in silence. Chridela watched him for a moment, but soon turned her attention to the heap of books. She picked one up and turned on a reading lamp.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009368	 {nl}"The first combat arenas and gladiators date back to around 900 years ago, to the reign of King Melkhiel.{nl}In time, the arenas began to develop, with more and more specialized varieties of gladiator differentiating themselves from their peers."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009369	 "Then, around 300 ago during the reign of King Freenel, as the Kingdom opened itself up to the exterior, foreign customs and traditions began to permeate the arenas. This lead to the creation of even more new specializations, like the Matadors."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009370	 "Although battles with animals and demons were already common in arenas around the Kingdom, the Matadors introduced a new style of combat which infused elements of pure spectacle into fierce confrontations with evil beasts."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009371	 "Evil beasts can be distinguished from demons by their lack of intelligence. While both originate from a demonic realm, evil beasts are equivalent to the animals that exist in our world.{nl}Facing these beasts, especially within the arena, required specialized knowledge and experience in combat techniques that were largely unknown prior to the emergence of the Matadors."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009372	 "Knowledge of evil beasts first arrived in the Kingdom through an arena manager who collected information from foreign tribal societies. The manager adapted their skills and know-how to his own expertise to design a new style of combat."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009373	 "His research and practices eventually gave origin to an entirely new profession in the arena. Throughout his life, he continued to polish and add new elements to the technique, until he acquired the official position of Master of the Matador class."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009374	 "The methods developed by the first Matador were considered highly innovative at the time, due to how they incorporated artistic notions in a style of combat tailored specifically to arena battles performed in front of an audience."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009375	 "The first big change in the Matador tradition is often pointed out as the time when the original techniques used against evil beasts were expanded and adjusted to include one-on-one confrontations."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009376	 "Although Matadors were often assisted by other fighters in combat, the need to face demonic beasts solo made it so that, over the course of three centuries, the profession of Matador became more and more specialized in this kind of conflict."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009377	 "Thus, unlike their predecessors who mastered the art of performing with evil beasts, the Matadors of today are largely recognized by their outstanding command of one-on-one combat."{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009378	 Chridela put down the book and picked up another one. She slowly browsed through the books in the pile one by one before concluding,{nl}[Does he expect me to learn everything by theory? I think I should at least watch some Matador matches tomorrow...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009379	 With that, she placed the books in a bag, turned off the light and left.{nl}If she was going to read all night, she may as well do it in the comfort of her own room, Chridela thought.
QUEST_20180418_009380	* Zealot Master Diaries{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009381	 When the funeral processions were over, the nearly 70 people in attendance assembled for a meeting of the Order.{nl} As they were mostly an exclusive group, without close contact with other clerics, there was barely any outsiders in their midst.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009382	 The family of the deceased were there to fulfill their duties, and those who knew of the events that had occurred were there as well, along with those sent customarily by the lord of the area to document the passing of a Master.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009383	 They stayed long enough to give their condolences before making a hasty exit and soon enough only the members of the Zealot Order remained.{nl}The only living Zealots of the world were all gathered there.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009384	 However, there was one person who was a stranger. A person who was not closely related to the order.{nl}His name was Phrevy. A middle-aged man sent by the Inquisitor Master, Thomas Iquinostasys, to witness the proceedings as the Zealot Master's position was now vacant.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009385	 Not open to outsiders and with little connection to other clergy, if it was not a meeting requiring an official appearance, it was not necessary for those like the Inquisitors to attend.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009386	 Yet, during this assembly, if the next Zealot Master was selected, it would be Phrevy who would have to verify the process, report back to the Inquisitor Master and later relay the message to the proper department of the Kingdom.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009387	 For generations, the Zealot Order would elect their Master and this person would make an appearance before the Inquisitor and other orders of the goddesses for approval before alerting the king. If there was no reason for adjustment the process would be complete.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009388	 Since it was typical for the Order to elect a new Master before the previous one had either passed away or retired, even if the Inquisitor Phrevy formally knew little about the proceedings, there was really not much to observe. 
QUEST_20180418_009389	 But this time, the assembly had reached a standstill.{nl}Therefore, including the dispatched Phrevy, all who were in attendance were determined that a decision must be reached.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009390	 Moreover, Phrevy was selected to act as chair for the assembly, thus proving that the friction within the Order was more serious than previously thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009391	 Although the Zealot Order did not consist of many members, they were divided and the span of the Order's history was practically the same as the two sides' lasting conflict. {nl}
QUEST_20180418_009392	 The Zealot Order was founded to recover the missing goddesses. However, the Order had separated into those who wished to seek out Goddess Laima first and those who wished to seek out Goddess Jurate. Both carrying their own opinions and reasoning for the matter.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009393	 There were those who believed Goddess Dahlia to be of the utmost importance, but compared to the other two groups whose numbers were 30 and 40, they carried no weight and dispersed themselves amongst the others.{nl}The end result being that their opinions on Goddess Dahlia were ignored.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009394	 Although this discord went on for some time, the Zealot Order was not divided.{nl}As a smaller order, they were aware of their precarious situation.{nl}And, even if the search for one goddess became paramount, they did not turn a blind eye on opportunities to find others.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009395	 This was because their mission was to find all the Goddesses, not to find a specific one.{nl}What was most important was their role to support the other existing Goddesses, their Orders, and the other Clerics.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009396	 Although the Zealots were not popular, because their goal was to find the missing goddesses, the other orders did not oppose them. Whether for honor's sake or out of empathy, they could do nothing but help the Zealot Order. 
QUEST_20180418_009397	 Because of this, the Zealots made their conflict known to the others in order to ensure that the matter did not make the already small order be forced to take on even more hardship.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009398	 At a previous assembly, David Tal, who was from the Laima followers, rose to a seat of power and was elected the Zealot Master.{nl}Those who served Jurate did not complain as, before this assembly, he had married Naomi, the daughter of an influential member of the Jurate followers.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009399	 For a short time it seemed as though the century old conflict would dissolve thanks to the marriage and David's successful ruling of the Order.{nl}He had gathered the Order's power and prepared them in the direction of finding Goddess Laima.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009400	 When a single lead appeared, he gathered a small group of Zealots and followed in pursuit.{nl}But the fact that the lead was fruitful is the sorrow of this story.{nl}It was here that David Tal faced his death, as he encountered another group who were in pursuit of Goddess Laima.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009401	 When David Tal passed away, the Order was stuck with heartache and further separation.{nl}After much backlash, Naomi succeeded her husband and became Zealot Master. However, a heavy atmosphere followed as there were those who followed Laima that believed it was because of Naomi that they lost David.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009402	 For many years Naomi ruled and, from pressure within the Order and due to her own personal interests to find her husband's killers, she continued their pursuit for Goddess Laima.{nl}These matters were one and the same and did not need to be pursued separately, yet the result led to her death as she too fell victim to those with connection to her husband's death.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009403	 (It would be revealed much later, but the one who played the main role behind their deaths was Evoniphon.{nl}Yet this truth would come much later to Aliza Tal, and by then Evoniphon would have had already left this world.){nl}
QUEST_20180418_009404	 It was due to this second death that today's funeral and assembly had taken place.{nl}And the reason for the current emotional divide between those who purse Laima and those who pursue Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009405	 There were extremists on one side who believed that if it wasn't for the pressure from those of the Order, Naomi Tal would not have been so reckless, and those on the other side who thought that the very marriage of David and Naomi was the problem.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009406	 Of course, there were those whose opinions were not as extreme, but it was unclear in which direction the assembly would go as their feelings of grief and resentment had yet to pass.{nl}The Zealot, who requested from Inquisitor Phrevy to speak first, stepped forward.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009407	 [I believe that the Zealot who has served our order the longest and who carries with them years of experience should be our next Master.]{nl}The person who fit these conditions was a follower of Laima.{nl}Another Zealot requested permission to speak and offered another opinion.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009408	 [Someone with experience is fine, but a Zealot who is strong and well disciplined would be better. I say this as it would be improper to overlook one who has the skill needed to be the next Master.] 
QUEST_20180418_009409	 This person was from a follower of Jurate. Although it seemed as though neither side had a person they wanted to recommend to speak, a third person requested.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009410	 [In all our years, we have yet to face a situation where two of our leaders have died and we have not selected another to lead. In this unprecedented moment, I would like to recommend that we consider another approach, different from history, when selecting the next head of the Order.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009411	 Here the question of what may that be was raised.{nl}Already prepared, the speaker calmly answered.{nl}[Our Order has set our sights on the task of finding the missing goddesses, but we have yet to succeed. I believe this to be because our Order is too independent and is, without proper reason, filled with pride.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009412	 The assembly erupted with cries about other clerics being complacent with the current situation and lazy in comparison.{nl}But after Inquisitor Phrevy quieted them down, the speaker continued.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009413	 [What you are saying is not wrong. However, receiving even the smallest bit of help from them and the goddesses that they follow would not be bad.] With that said, the speaker continued with a counterargument.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009414	 [In truth, we have not received an answer from the other goddesses about the whereabouts of Goddess Laima. There are various reasons for this but one, in particular, is that we as humans do not know the whole story. However, we should still be proud of ourselves for the handwork it takes to ask such questions.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009415	 The other clerics have accepted the work of the goddesses, but it is all of us who feel hurt at their absence. This is why I think it would be acceptable for us to put our faith in the Oracle Master at this time. Is it not possible that in this time of crisis the goddess will show us the way?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009416	 An other Zealot addressed the question.{nl}[The goddess knows what is best for us but She will not intervene with our choices. If this was not the case, the goddess would make it known to us who amongst the royals would be the best King.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009417	 Or better yet, we wouldn't even need a royal family. Finding who amongst us should be king would be a simple task. Just have the goddess provide us with the proper ruler. At this point, why not have the goddess simply sit on the throne Herself and rule?{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009418	 Then we will not even have to worry about the monarch. You have studied our theology. Are you saying that you are unaware of the flaws in this thinking?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009419	 [That is correct, however, 200 years ago King Enael was nominated through the Oracle. The king before, King Olukel was the first to step down from the throne due to intervention by the goddess. There are times when these means are necessary.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009420	 The goddesses from our faith and theology take deep consideration for human will, but this does not mean They will stop it. Let us ask. Let us seek out the Oracle. If we do not receive an answer, we will simply return here.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009421	 It will take time, but nothing else. If the divine goddess breaks from tradition and intervenes, I doubt that anyone here of the Zealot Order will object to Her decision.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009422	 Inquisitor Phrevy, whose role was to judge the decisions of the assembly, examined those before him.{nl}It seemed no one disagreed. Either they all concurred or there were only a few who didn't.{nl}It was at this time that another person requested the floor.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009423	 It was a young woman who had just come of age.{nl}Aliza Tal, whose mother was the Zealot Master who passed away, and whose father was the Master who passed away the time before, spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009424	 [I agree that we should speak with the Oracle. But I have one request. I would like us to ask the Oracle, not who should be the next master, but if I, Aliza Tal, would be fit for the role.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009425	 My brothers and sisters, you have suggested we select one who has years of experience and is well disciplined in our teachings. Although I do not have such qualifications I would like to know.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009426	 If it is I who is meant to continue my parent's, the previous Master's, dream of unity within the order and recovery of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009427	 If the prophecy is for me, I will be able to fulfill our goals as I have learned the teachings and thoughts of both sides and within me is the blood of our Order.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009428	 If my brothers and sisters agree with seeking the Oracle along with my request, and if I receive the goddess' blessing, I will follow the guidance of the prophecy.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009429	 The members of the Order nosily spoke amongst themselves.{nl}After their talks had cooled, a few rose from their seats and whispered into the ear of the moderator, Inquisitor Phrevy.{nl}After listening to the opinions of these representatives of the Order, Inquisitor Phrevy began to speak.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009430	 [All are in agreement to speak with the Goddess through the Oracle Master. The question to be asked will be about the role of Aliza Tal. If there are any Zealots who oppose this decision, speak now.]{nl}He waited, but there was no one who objected.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009431	 [Good. Then the plan is in motion. If Aliza Tal rejects the prophecy, or the prophecy given does not pertain to her, the task of choosing the next nominee is once again the responsibility of the Zealot Order and we will return to this place again to discuss the matter.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009432	 We will now bring this assembly to a close and return after receiving the prophecy.] Three days later the Order, to the surprise of the other clerics, received their message through the Oracle Master. 
QUEST_20180418_009433	 The result revealed that Aliza Tal was to become the Zealot Master.{nl} The path ahead for this young Master could be one of honor or one of unbearable hardship. 
QUEST_20180418_009434	 * The Shadow Master's Experiment Journal Part 1{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009435	 Ubik took a deep breath and turned around.{nl}She saw, in the seats provided, the various mage Masters sitting side by side.{nl}Some were apathetic, while others looked on with anticipation.{nl}But regardless of how there Masters felt, Ubik did not want to fail before any of them.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009436	 With great composure, Ubik signaled towards her students and a monster began to take shape from the shadows.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009437	  Remembering its name would be a task for another day.{nl}Ubik, knowing it would be a failure to lose focus now, carefully, but with quick precision, completed her casting.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009438	 The monster's pursuing shadow shot out into four arrows - arrows so sharp they hung like needles.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009439	 These arrows embedded themselves, one by one, into each of the monster's four feet.{nl}The monster let out a shriek as it found itself pinned to the ground.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009440	 The shadow crawled from the monster's feet up to its legs threading and separating into separated arrows above and below, crisscrossing around and swiftly piercing the monster's body with sixteen strikes.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009441	 The shadow then rose above the monster and formed into a gigantic lance and whatever breath was left was taken away with one swift strike that pierced the monster's head.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009442	 The demonstration complete, Shadowmancer Master Ubik turned to face the various Masters that sat on the platform behind her.{nl}The first to comment was the Sorcerer Master, Dame Circe.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009443	 [That shadow control is something that can only be seen at the Master's level, no? I think it would be hard for other Shadowmancers to follow. You have gathered too many Masters here to perform a feat that only one of Master level can perform.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009444	 Before Ubik could respond with [That little...], Wican Celestic stepped in.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009445	 [Circe is correct. If it is a skill of this level that other Shadowmancer cannot follow then it is indeed nothing but magically valuable.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009446	 Also, seeing as how the Sorcerer Master also has a similar skill to reflect a demon's shadow, you may not be able to invoke the amount that she can summon.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009447	 While Ubik thought that Wican always agrees with Circe, Winona Ende spoke up.{nl}[But Ubik is not fighting Circe, and not all sorcerer can control demons like Sorcerer Master. It is not completely useless.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009448	 This time Ili Teird spoke.{nl}[You are all correct. However, let us move on to the next demonstration. If we continue to discuss after each display, one day will not be enough.]{nl}With that, Ubik turned back around and motioned again to her students, who released a second monster.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009449	 This time without appearing to move, Ubik pinned the monster to the ground.{nl}And this time Thaumaturge Master Larisa was first to gave her opinion.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009450	 [Isn't this the normal skill of a Shadowmancer? To pin down an opponent's shadow so that is unable to move? It's a skill that they all know.]{nl}[Correct,] Ubik answered and signaled.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009451	 Her students began to turn on and off the magic flames that were prepared on all sides. Even during the day the flames were strong and more shadows of the monster appeared. But that was not all.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009452	 The monster began to be yanked around by the shadows that had just newly formed.{nl}And as it was restrained to its shadow, if the shadow suddenly appeared in another location or drastically changed shape or direction, the body too was forcefully moved to follow suit.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009453	 Each time the monster hit the ground it received physical damage.{nl}The monster was then dragged into the air and slammed into the hard ground multiple times until the monster was no more.{nl}Ubik turned around again to face the other Master's criticisms.
QUEST_20180418_009454	 This time again Sorcerer Master Circe was the first to speak.{nl}[To fight like this, isn't it a problem to have to prepare lighting every time?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009455	 Linker Master Winona Ende Spoke afterward.{nl}[I can use linking technology well, and I can do it without preliminaries if I instantly place a glowing object like a fireball or something of magic every side.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009456	 This is a technical application for a joint battle with other mages. This might be the original intention.]{nl}Ubik liked that Winona mentioned linkage attacks.{nl}But that did not last long as Psychokino Ili Terid soon said:{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009457	 [But if you're going to give the enemy a physical shock like that, why don't you just do this?]{nl}After saying so, Ili Terid grabbed, with his telekinesis power, the body of the monster that was already dead and he waved it back and forth.{nl}Wican Celestic intervened without hesitation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009458	 [Of course if there are times where I cannot get the help of Telekinesis or Psychokino, that would be the situation when I would need this. But it doesn't seem very efficient.]{nl}Sorcerer Master Circe rose from her sit and spoke,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009459	 [I understand that the Shadowmancer Master has taken Shadowmancer magic to a higher level. But I don't feel as though the other mage Masters necessarily needed to see it. I would like to see more, but sadly I'm too busy. This is all I will watch for today.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009460	 With that, Dame Circe along with Wican Celestic said their goodbyes.{nl}The other mage Masters, some of which were interested in the demonstration and wanted to stay, were divided on what to do next.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009461	 At the time, the quiet Chronomancer Master Lucid Winterspoon rose from her chair.{nl}As she was their elder, the other Masters as well stood up and began to say their goodbyes to Ubik.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009462	 Although the first to stand, Lucid Winterspoon was the last to approach.{nl}[It seems that my action has caused a  reaction through the others, but that was not my true intention.]{nl}Ubik heard this and spoke,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009463	 [Was that not what you had intended when you rose from your seat?]{nl}[Yes, there was that. But that was not all. I wanted to speak with you alone.]{nl}Ubik was both excited and worried about what this living legend of magic has to say.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009464	 Lucid Winterspoon said,{nl}[As a result, of magic you just demonstrated, you were able to send the body of the tied down shadow to another place. If you develop this further you would be able to apply this to teleportation. Have you thought of that?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009465	 [But to do that, I will have to solve the problem of physical shock upon arrival. The further the distance the stronger the shock. So of course, you could send the monster a shorter distance and they will not be damaged. But it depends.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009466	 Lucid Winterspoon grinned at hearing those words and said,{nl}[If that was the only problem, then in comparison it would be easily solvable.]{nl}Ubik thought for a moment and replied,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009467	 [Plus, another problem is, if you want to send the shadow further, one will need stronger lighting as well. And lights need to be installed the further the location. Plus if the body isn't there, there is no way to send the shadow of that body first.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009468	 [Then what if you do not use your own shadow. What if you used the shadow of something else?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009469	 [I've never considered that so I'm not sure if it is possible. I would have to come to that conclusion through research, no? To send my shadow or to send the shadow of someone else, the problem is still the same as the one before.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009470	 Without a way to call on stronger lights and the shadow first, the body will still need to go to the place to reach the shadows.]{nl}Lucid Winterspoon grinned again and said,{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009471	 [And if that shadow was the moon's?]{nl}At those words, Ubik's expression changed.{nl}[That's genius! If you can utilize the shadow of the solar or lunar eclipse then one can call upon it from anywhere. I hadn't thought of that.]
QUEST_20180418_009472	 Lucid Winterspoon spoke again.{nl}[Well, try. Teleportation has been considered inefficient but until trying, you won't know. How would you feel about researching this type of magic? I will be able to help you from time to time.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009473	 [Yes, why not? I will start from today. Thank you so much. This is an amazing idea, Master Lucid.]{nl}And from that day forward, the Shadowmancer Master was known as Eclipse Ubik.
QUEST_20180418_009474	 * Winter Flint{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009475	 A mansion, dating back centuries, had been overtaken by a melancholy mood that matched its aging years. {nl}Yet, it was not always like that.{nl}Just a few weeks ago, the mansion glowed with the prestige it had gathered over the years and the atmosphere not so heavy.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009476	 But, the actions of a certain someone led to a family meeting being held in a mood so somber that it affected not only the disposition of the mansion but the extended family as well.{nl}Walking down a corridor of this mansion, in the direction of the meeting, were two men and one woman.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009477	 Of these three people, the one to the far right, Vaidotas Winterspoon, addressed the man walking to his left.{nl}[I did wrong. I will not do so again in the future. That is what you will say. Understood? Don't speak of anything else.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009478	 The woman interjected. [But, why must our Flint apologize? And you, Vaidotas, are being quite annoying.]{nl}[You are the annoying one, Lucienne. Do you then think it's alright for Flint to be punished?]{nl}[What did he do that this is the case?{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009479	 [I also think he did nothing wrong. But if it's all so simple, why have the elders gone so far as to hold a family meeting?]{nl}[For the elders to feel the need to do so, shows how old fashioned they are. If Flint inherits the head of the household our family will have to change as well.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009480	 [It's important that he first endures today's meeting before considering his inheritance.]{nl}Although Flint was carefully listening to the words of his cousins, he did not speak.{nl} It was not that he refused to answer, but rather he had yet to decide what it was that he would do.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009481	 Whether they were aware of this or not, Vaidotas and Lucienne continued their debate until the three of them arrived at the doors of the meeting.{nl}Just before opening the door, Vaidotas stressed his previous thoughts onto Flint one final time.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009482	 The door, now opened, revealed dozens of men and women sitting inside the hall.{nl} A look around and one would note a single, remote chair that was prepared as though its future occupant was to face trial or interrogation. To the front and at an angle on either side of this chair, the men and women waited.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009483	 Vaidotas and Lucienne took their seats in their respective places.{nl}And, without a word, Flint Winterspoon, the man who had followed them both, took his place at the center in the lone chair.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009484	 However you viewed it, this event was for him. Although his seat seemed that of a criminal on trial, he was today's main protagonist.{nl}In other words, today these people would judge if he would be a hero or a villain. {nl}From that perspective, you could say he was less like a criminal waiting trial and more like an actor awaiting the reviews of the audience.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009485	 Now there was but one place of honor that remained empty.{nl}If this place was also filled then the hall would seat 33.{nl}However, if one excludes the man sitting in the place of the defendant, there were only 31 people sitting around him, staring him down.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009486	 An elderly man, sitting to the right of the empty place of honor, opened his mouth to speak. {nl}[With this, the current members of the Winterspoon family who have completed the rite of passage, for the exception of one, have all gathered here today. In place of our vacant Patriarch, I will take the role of eldest and announce the start of the 817th Family Meeting.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009487	 He paused slightly before continuing.{nl}[Kohath Winterspoon you have requested the right to speak and thus, you may go first.]{nl}To his right, a man sitting in the center of the group rose, bowed his head towards the rest of the family in greeting, and spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009488	 [This meeting was originally intended to be a joyful one to fill the vacancy of the Patriarch in the family. However, it is unfortunate that one of our members, who was a strong candidate for such a position, has been suspected of violating the family law and the rules of the alchemists. This meeting now serves as an investigation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009489	 Our family has been regarded for centuries as the most prestigious in the kingdom and the very founders of alchemy.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009490	 Kohath took a breath, then spoke on. {nl}One. An Alchemist's research and results will not interfere with the divine providence of the Goddesses.{nl}Two. An Alchemist's research and results will not bring harm to the Goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009491	 Three. An Alchemist will never use the Goddesses or humans as raw material.{nl}All Alchemist will seek to follow the aforementioned provisions and will work to ensure others do as well. {nl}As you know, as a member of this family, these are the first sentences you learn and last that you keep until the day you die.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009492	 Yet, it seems that Flint Winterspoon has allowed these rules to slip his mind. He hopes to use alchemy to craft more powerful weapons. If we begin to use the skills and capability of our family to create such things, what sort of issues will arise?{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009493	 What sort of horrible place will our world become if these weapons exist? I judge that we stop this type of research and experimentation. There is not one person in the history of the Winterspoon family who has directly used alchemy to develop weapons.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009494	 No, even more, no one has spared the thought. And to come here and hear that the person who will be inheriting the family hopes to use alchemy as a foundation to create weapons cannot be ignored.]{nl}When he was done, a young man raised his hand and asked for permission to address the family.{nl}The elderly man gave such permission with his eyes, and the younger one began.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009495	 It was Vaidotas Winterspoon. {nl}[What was just said does not match the truth. Cheminis Sword, Vine Equipment, Riena Equipment and more were all created by our family or were provided for by our skill. With these weapons we have made great contributions to the kingdom by saving many lives.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009496	 If we consider this example, and continue to think that making weapons with alchemy is a problem then this would lead to the absurd thinking that all blacksmiths and weapon makers in our world are killers who do not know the sanctity of life.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009497	 Although a select few nodded at Vaidotas words, Kohath did not stand down.{nl}[Do you think I don't know that? My nephew knows of only one thing and speaks unknowingly of the second. Do you know how long ago gun powder was invented?{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009498	 During the time of Sosel the 2nd, our family created gun power, yet as time passed, as powerful as it may be, gun power based weapons did not become the norm. Even the majority of the Kingdom's soldiers use spears and swords. Have you considered why?{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009499	 But before Vaidotas could retort, another person raised their hand.{nl}This time it was Lucienne Winterspoon. {nl}With permission, she began to speak.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009500	 [Nonetheless, the Royal Army does use Sappers and Cannons. The reason why the Kingdom tends not to use gun power is because they are already using weapons founded in magic and divine energy that are just as good as gun powder.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009501	 But this doesn't mean that gun power is weak. Guns and swords are all just weapons. Our family applied alchemy to swords and spears, so there is no reason for us not to do the same with gun powder based weapons.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009502	 It is our family that has developed gun power and we should consider it time to develop it further, Father.]{nl}And with grace Lucienne Winterspoon ended her appeal.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009503	 But Kohath words were harsh.{nl}[I have failed as my daughter’s teacher. From the time of Sosel the 2nd for thousands of years, you think that various patriarchs have not thought of applying such research because of a lack of curiosity or ability? It was through wisdom and discretion that they began to realize the dangers.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009504	 Before either Lucienne or Vaidotas could recover permission to speak, the doors flew open and a single person walked in. Although not a usual attendant of such meeting, it was for this person that the highest chair of honor was left vacant.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009505	 And though not many were used to seeing her, all members of the family knew her face.{nl}It was not a face easy to forget even if seen only once over several decades. {nl}Time had passed and yet her features had not changed at all, making her all the more recognizable.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009506	 When she entered the room, the other members of the family rose from their seats and bowed their heads in reverence of the eldest member.{nl}And as she walked, she began to speak.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009507	 [Although I have attended great meetings, it has been awhile since I've attended one where the moment it opens a debate has already started.]{nl}The elderly man who was acting representative addressed her.{nl}[It has been awhile, Great Aunt.]{nl}The woman, Lucid Winterspoon casually nodded her head and disappeared.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009508	 Reappearing in the vacant chair high above.{nl}[As time went by I grew tired of being called Grandmother, Great Grandmother, Great-Great-Grandmother and asked to go by Great Aunt, but Kenaz, we are both old and to hear you call me that has put me off.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009509	 Lucid Winterspoon took her seat and the rest if the family followed suit.{nl}As Kenaz Winterspoon considered what to say, Lucid stopped him.{nl}[In the time it took to approach this chair I saw all that had occurred here. You do not need to explain it to me.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009510	 With that said, Lucid turned her attention to the man sitting in the defendant's chair, Flint Winterspoon.{nl}[It is not clear if pausing a heated discussion is the best idea,{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009511	 but if the opinions differ so much as to start a fight and where opposing opinions could lead to further misunderstandings, the discussion must be put to rest. And I think that time has come.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009512	 After speaking, Lucid took a moment to examine the other members one by one. She saw in them the descendants of her brothers and sisters who had long passed away centuries ago. Then spoke again.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009513	 [Although, I would like us to share our thoughts and wisdom to work towards an appropriate conclusion, I know that the truth is that we do not have the time.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009514	 The elder man, Kenaz Winterspoon, who was acting speaker, spoke.{nl}[Great Aunt, as observer of time and eldest of us all, if you say as such then it is fine. However, we are aware that you often separate yourself from the events of the family and even that of the outside world, but{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009515	 sometimes there are times where you do interfere and only afterwards do we understand why. If there is a patriarch that you wish to chose, then we will trust your wisdom and gather together to prepare for such a person.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009516	 No matter who is selected by you, we will not refuse them.]{nl}[My answer does not bear with it wisdom of such expectation. And more importantly, it is not the wisdom of the decision that is important, but the effort set to reach the intended result.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009517	 Regrettably, time is short. Which is why I have given you the task of presiding over these assemblies.]{nl}[Speak.]{nl}Kenaz replied, but Lucid Winterspoon directed her next question towards Flint.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009518	 [This whole time, we still have not asked you of your opinion. Hearing the opinion of the others is important, but first we must hear from you. What are your thoughts? Do you wish to use alchemy to develop these powerful bullets and sell them?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009519	 Flint Winterspoon, shocked by the appearance of a famous family member he had only heard stories about, was at a loss for words.{nl}As such, Lucid Winterspoon waited quietly for the answer and this was the result.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009520	 The time to personally meet Lucid Winterspoon and greet her or ask her questions had already passed, and as such his reply was short.{nl}[I would prefer if it was not summarized in that way, but your summary is not wrong. Great Aunt.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009521	 Lucid Winterspoon turned back to the whole assembly{nl}[For the exception of a few, the majority of the family members here oppose this thought. I, for one, think that working on something again with alchemy that I have left untouched for the last 100 years would bring exciting developments...]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009522	 Kohath Winterspoon's mouth fell open and a weak indignant voice escaped his lips.{nl}[Great Aunt!]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009523	 But Lucid Winterspoon silenced him with a wave of her finger.{nl}[This is not the time to get excited, my boy. I simply mean that I do not wish to deal with the family's work here and there. And I am past the age of being able to do such exciting experiments...{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009524	 She stopped and after a long paused continued again.{nl}[I understand that this is not the opinion you would like to hear. But if anyone shares a different one then feel free to speak. But right now, I will ask Flint. The work you would like to do, can you complete it with the help of our family?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009525	 Flint's expression changed.{nl}It was because he had never let the thought cross his mind.{nl}Lucienne and Vaidotas, who were sitting amongst the family, shared a look over this exciting prospect and waited for Flint's response with anticipation.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009526	 The other family members as well shared a similar anticipation as they stared at Flint.{nl} His concerns were many, but time was short and the answer he had for himself was ever more so.{nl}Thus his answer came easy.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009527	 [Of course not. I would not need to focus on the Winterspoon's family power or influence. But, the problem remains that I will not be using my skills for the family.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009528	 [If that is the case, why do you feel the need to convince them? If you have no interest in the patriarch seat, can't you simply go and do the work you wish? If you feel frustrated and unable to use your talents within the family, then leave. The family will not collapse without you.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009529	 I know this because I, too, have done nothing to contribute to the family for centuries.]{nl}Kohath and a few others wished to protest but,{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009530	 the family, for centuries, faced no problems with the absence of Lucid's alchemy and there was no evidence to support the opinion that removing Flint would suddenly cause problems.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009531	 But Flint was still shocked by the idea of leaving the family, a thought that had never occurred to him. But as he thought about it the more the idea was to his liking.{nl}When Lucid Winterspoon saw this change she was prompted to speak.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009532	 [If Flint leaves the family, then whatever work he does we have no reason to interfere. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the foundation of Flint's work is our own teachings.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009533	 So, if you carry the Winterspoon name you cannot complete the work you would like to do. Whatever comes next will be difficult, and ending your connection with the family will also bring challenges, so in the future go by the name, Winterwood.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009534	 I ask that you use this name as a guide to remember to walk the path between what you have learned from the family and what you hope to do in your own work.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009535	 Kohath spoke.{nl}[Saying he will leave the family does not excuse him from the rules of alchemy. It is not just our family but all Alchemists in the Kingdom -- no the world who must adhere to these immutable principles.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009536	 Lucid Winterspoon replied.{nl}[I know your worries. But Flint is not the type of person to use what he has learned with reckless abandonment. You too already know this, no? And I also believe that in the long-term this work will be good for the family and for the advancement of our world.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009537	 Have you forgotten that I am a Chronomancer? And if you would like to discuss the rules of alchemy, it was I who was at the center of its creation. Forget the thought that you can tie me down using the fear of these principles.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009538	 Kenaz, not waiting to miss the opportunity to keep the rarely seen Lucid Winterspoon involved with the family, spoke.{nl}[If it pleases you, how about also recommending the next head of the family? Just mention a promising person to be patriarch and you can go your way.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009539	 If the person Lucid picks does become the next patriarch, and Lucid is there to help them the success of the family would be even greater.{nl}If one considers the generations of patriarchs who had begged Lucid earnestly for a single shred of advice, this was an opportunity the family could not let slip by.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009540	 [You should pick a person from the next generation. Vaidotas would do well. The family elders will help to guide the younger Patriarch...]{nl}Kohath who was ignoring Kenaz's gaze had a need to object this time too.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009541	 [Vaidotas' alchemist abilities are fine. But he does not share the same strength as Flint. He is but a scholar. And, as you know, to be the patriarch you need to have a certain level of fighting skill as well.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009542	 On hearing this, Kenaz realized that Kohath was not opposed to Vaidotas as leader but rather wanted to restrain Lucid to the role of looking after a weaker patriarch.{nl}To ensure what this is what was said, Lucid Winterspoon spoke first.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009543	 [Since he is still young we can prepare him for the title and develop areas where is he lacking. If you feel anxious, we can send him to train. In fact, let us do this.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009544	 Recently, the Swordsman Master gave up his public office and retired to Klaipeda. Let us send Vaidotas to Klaipeda to receive his guidance.]{nl}The elder, Kenaz, spoke.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009545	 [Learning how to fight like a warrior isn't bad, but don't you think, if it is possible, learning how to fight as a Wizard from you, Great Aunt, would be simpler?]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009546	 [The Wizard Society would be in an uproar if I trained him. It would be seen as favoritism and I will still need to be responsible for the work I am supposed to do. Send him south.{nl} 
QUEST_20180418_009547	 Let him experience the Great Woodlands and other areas, and along the way I will teach him about the climate of each region and their special materials. It has been hundreds of years since I've trained someone in alchemy. But I will yield this amount. In this case you will arrive to Klaipeda a bit late, but warrior training needs not to be rushed.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009548	 At this, Lucid stopped and closed her eyes for a moment.{nl}‘No…if our family’s members try to save this world, even just a small step it will prove difficult. We will have to match the time…{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009549	 We cannot be too strong, nor weak, we must match the moment perfectly… It doesn’t need to be Vaidotas, but there is also no reason not to. As long as it does not interfere with the providence and expectations of the Goddesses, it will be okay…’{nl}And like that the thought disappeared.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009550	 Of course, she could not share her thinking with the others.{nl}Instead, she turned to Flint and spoke.{nl}[You have given up the burden of Patriarch, but there is other work you must bear.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009551	 I will pray that the honor of the goddesses be revealed through you. You still retain half of the family name and for that you must carry our reputation with you.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009552	 This frustrated Flint.{nl}[If someone else has said that I would not have found it so strange, but from you Great Aunt, I do not know.]{nl}At that accusation, Lucid replied.{nl}[Oh? But it is like that, no? Even if we go our separate ways, no matter how far we go, we cannot be fully apart.]{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009553	 When those words were spoken, Lucid Winterspoon, without a single goodbye began to disappear.{nl}The remaining family members, who were used to this behavior, sent her off by bowing their heads.{nl}
QUEST_20180418_009554	 Although they did not have the ability to see as far into the future as Lucid, they could feel that this was the start of a new era.{nl}However, not one of them remaining there knew how difficult this new era would be.

QUEST_20180629_009711	Before, all you needed was unyielding faith and a healthy body to protect yourself from evil spirits.{nl}Yet now that these forces have become more violent since Medzio Diena, even the strongest stand no chance.
QUEST_20180629_009712	You wish to become an Exorcist...{nl}We, Exorcists, are different from Warlocks in that our task is to use the Goddesses' strength to exorcise these evil spirits.
QUEST_20180629_009713	As you will need to come face-to-face with such beings, the path to become an Exorcist is far from easy.{nl}Even if you do become one, you will be fighting against impossible odds with no end.
QUEST_20180629_009714	Knowing this, do you still wish to become an Exorcist? 
QUEST_20180629_009715	Understood.{nl}It takes time to train an Exorcist properly.{nl}As such, since Medzio Diena, the number of Exorcists available to combat the rise of the evil forces is few.
QUEST_20180629_009716	As such, in order to speed up the process, only those who can exorcise an evil spirit can be recruited.{nl}You will need three high-ranked Clerics to vouch for your ability.
QUEST_20180629_009717	First, gain the approval of the Krivis Master, the Priest Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
QUEST_20180629_009718	After receiving their approval, return here to study and be tested on Exorcist theory.{nl}And lastly, you will need to perform an exorcism from start to finish by distinguishing whether a person is possessed or not.

QUEST_20180629_009727	I would like you to make this medicine and deliver it to Commander Julian in Dvasia Peak.

QUEST_20180629_009740	The History of Exorcism Volume 1
QUEST_20180629_009741	The History of Exorcism
QUEST_20180629_009742	Preface{nl}Clerics have always been careful to record the histories of faith and theology. However, there are certain fields where the historical and theological achievements have not been made known to the public despite their documentation.
QUEST_20180629_009743	One such case is that of the Exorcists, which shall be discussed here.{nl}In truth, the history of the Exorcists, along with their theoretical achievements attained through the practice of exorcism and the development of such skills, are not material fit for the general public.
QUEST_20180629_009744	In addition, it is inevitable that these records contain the personal information of victims both saved and lost through exorcism.{nl}These documents have been classified for the reason that the disclosure of such information is an infringement of the victims' personal rights.{nl}The confidentiality of the documents is difficult to object, as breaching the personal rights of victims is not justifiable in any case.
QUEST_20180629_009745	Apart from the historical records and research achievements already kept by other Clerics, it is imperative that I, as the Sage Master, record all that I know for the sake of practicality and public benefit.
QUEST_20180629_009746	To fulfill this role, I will now briefly discuss the world of Exorcists, detailing their techniques and rituals, even if it means that I must alter the names of the locations and the people involved.
QUEST_20180629_009747	It was fortunate of us to have had the approval of the Kingdom's bureaucracies in recording the actual names of the locations and people involved for historical accuracy, but most names of those involved have been altered.{nl}Do take heed that any similarities or any assumptions you may draw about the recorded events are most likely to be far from the truth.
QUEST_20180629_009748	In the cases where one may have correctly guessed the true names of the locations and people involved, bear in mind that it is best to keep these conjectures to oneself out of politeness and decency.
QUEST_20180629_009749	Lastly, I advise you – it is best not to disgrace yourself by publicizing these speculations and bringing them before the King's court with the intention of undermining their honor.
QUEST_20180629_009750	Year 1020 of the Kingdom under the 2nd year of the Reign of Domipel, Sage Master Kelemborer Martial
QUEST_20180629_009751	Origins of the Exorcist
QUEST_20180629_009752	It was during the reign of Lomel II that Exorcists first gained official recognition.
QUEST_20180629_009753	Many Clerics had dabbled in exorcism before that, but the Order of the Exorcists was established during the time in which Lomel II facilitated the organization of the many orders and denominations of Clerics.
QUEST_20180629_009754	From then on, only those sanctioned by the court were recognized as Exorcists and were allowed to perform exorcisms.{nl}The Clerics, regardless of their sincerity or rank, were forbidden from practicing the art.
QUEST_20180629_009755	With these clear boundaries in place, the Exorcists were able to build upon their experiences and accumulate their knowledge.
QUEST_20180629_009756	The History of Exorcism Book 2
QUEST_20180629_009757	The Early History of Exorcism
QUEST_20180629_009758	The early history of exorcism began with the discovery of possessions and their treatment.{nl}The first phase involves distinguishing those that are possessed from those who feign it. The early Exorcists were required to firmly establish a process for discernment.
QUEST_20180629_009759	These methods of discernment were established early in the Exorcists' history from their collective experiences obtained through trial-and-error and shared within their circle by word of mouth, their secrets guarded from the general public.
QUEST_20180629_009760	Now comes the second phase.{nl}The treatment of the possessed differs greatly depending on the nature of the perpetrator, whether it be a demon, an evil spirit or simply a ghost.{nl}There are also different types of possessions – the demon could simply possess the victim, just hold them captive, damage the victim mentally and leave for good or visit the victim regularly to do them harm.
QUEST_20180629_009761	Also, as clergymen, Exorcists have the responsibility not only in exorcising a demon or a spirit but also in healing those that have been victimized by a possession.{nl}So it was necessary for early Exorcists to have undergone training as a Cleric as well.{nl}All the more, if one had the abilities as a healer, one could be trained as an Exorcist without training as a Cleric or a Plague Doctor.
QUEST_20180629_009762	While caring for victims had been a crucial part of being an Exorcist in the early days, such practices soon lost their importance as the types of demons and the cases of possession grew drastically in number.
QUEST_20180629_009763	In conclusion, the duties of the Exorcists shifted towards the offensive because of the need for a stronger offensive against the demon forces, and they have come to open their doors to Clerics to assist in the healing of the victims as of late.
QUEST_20180629_009764	On the Nature of Possessions: Ghosts, Demons, and Evil Spirits
QUEST_20180629_009765	Once it is determined that the victim is not feigning possession or just suffering from mental illness, the next important step is to diagnose what is possessing the victim.
QUEST_20180629_009766	There are four causes for possessions.{nl}The last of the four causes does not need to be mentioned here, so the three main causes would be demons, ghosts and evil spirits.
QUEST_20180629_009767	An evil spirit, in the case of possessions, refers not to a ghost but a specific type of ghosts that have joined the demonic forces.{nl}Therefore the word ghost, in this specific text, refers to a wandering soul of a deceased person that has no relations to a demon.
QUEST_20180629_009768	In addition, when speaking of demons we mean, of course, those who have originated from the demonic world.
QUEST_20180629_009769	From the early days of the Exorcists, the difficulty of the exorcism was as follows: Demons > Evil Spirits > Ghosts.{nl}It is only natural that demons, regardless of rank, were more powerful than a ghost or a demonic spirit, and the experiences of the Exorcists in the field did not contradict this view, allowing it to be the standard for some time.
QUEST_20180629_009770	Many years passed, then something happened that completely turned this order of difficulty upside down.{nl}A capable priest, whose name has been withheld by the Exorcist Order, was performing an Exorcism on a possession that she had correctly identified as demon.{nl}She discovered that demons would withdraw from their victims when she stated that the demon's possession was threatening the life of the one possessed. When this approach was proved to be effective for all demonic possessions, the exorcism of demons became a much easier task.
QUEST_20180629_009771	Since the discovery, the difficulty levels in exorcism shifted as such: Evil Spirits > Ghosts > Demons.{nl}It may be strange that evil spirits are more difficult to deal with than ghosts despite their ties to the demonic forces.{nl}Evil spirits were more powerful than ghosts because of their demonic ties and, unlike actual demons, would not retreat from their victims when correctly identified by the Exorcist.
QUEST_20180629_009772	As there were no further developments, Exorcists had to be satisfied that at least one case of possession, that of the demons, had become easier to handle.{nl}And though they had discovered this new exorcism method that made the older methods obsolete, the Exorcist Order could not fundamentally understand how and why it worked.
QUEST_20180629_009773	One could guess that this is because of some relationship between the Goddesses and demons that we humans do not understand. But because of the secrecy of the Exorcist Order, which is on par with that of the Zealots, it is difficult to speculate further.
QUEST_20180629_009774	The History of Exorcism Book 3
QUEST_20180629_009775	New Discoveries in Possessions: Divine Spirit and Miko
QUEST_20180629_009776	In addition to the three causes for possessions – Demon, Evil Spirit, and Ghost – there is also a fourth that has only recently come to the attention of the Exorcists.
QUEST_20180629_009777	Because of this, it is possible that failed cases Exorcists had previously recorded as incurable or ambiguous were such instances.
QUEST_20180629_009778	In conclusion, this new aggressor is what the Miko call Divine Spirits.{nl}However, it is rare for such spirits to possess humans and even rarer for when they do for them to cause harm.{nl}It is even more uncommon for them to purposely cause harm out of malicious intents.
QUEST_20180629_009779	To emphasize this point further, one must discern the nature of the spirit and see if they have in fact intentionally possessed a human. Usually, if it is not by accident or through human ignorance that the event has occurred, it's possible that the victim may have previously done harm to the attacking spirit. Or that the possessor is actually evil.
QUEST_20180629_009780	It is very rare that a divine spirit will intentionally harm a human.{nl}However, there are cases where this has happened and if a time comes to write about them, I will.
QUEST_20180629_009781	These facts have been found through research, and accurate theoretical truth has been established thanks to communication between the Miko and the societies of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20180629_009782	After these times, the Exorcists have passed on the responsibility for such cases to the Miko if it involves a divine spirit.{nl}Unlike possessions done by a demon, evil spirit, or ghost, even a powerful Exorcist using the divine power of the Goddesses cannot expel a divine spirit without using excessive force. However, with the appearance of the Miko, new methods have been developed.
QUEST_20180629_009783	In cases where a Miko is too far away to provide help or due to certain circumstances is unable to, the Exorcist can still use their superior psychic strength.{nl}One could say they are a healer engaging in a field that is not their profession.
QUEST_20180629_009784	Exorcists do not speak publicly, and recently this has become even more the case since the Miko Master has taken office. The reason for such behavior is unknown. (Originally written by the previous Sage Master, it as been corrected to include Information about the Divine Spirits and the Miko. 1093 Year of the Kingdom - Lufas Kehel)
QUEST_20180629_009785	The History of Exorcism Book 4
QUEST_20180629_009786	Exorcist Private Documents
QUEST_20180629_009787	By order from the Inquisitor Master, in accordance to the law of the Kingdom and those of the religious orders, the following documents are classified and are only available to Exorcists or those seeking to become Exorcist as deemed so by the Exorcist Master. 
QUEST_20180629_009788	Regardless of one's status in the Kingdom or rank in the Order, those who violate this order shall be punished.{nl}The authorization to read this document is limited to the King, the Exorcist Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
QUEST_20180629_009789	Disclosing the contents of this document will also result in punishment.{nl}In addition, if there is an Exorcist engaging in work where knowing the content of these documents is deemed unnecessary, it is unnecessary to release the details and keeping them a secret is fine as this was the case for many Exorcists in the past.
QUEST_20180629_009790	A Shift in the Nature of the Exorcist: Fighting Demons
QUEST_20180629_009791	You may come to understand by observing modern Exorcists that their most distinctive feature is not their exorcisms or their healing abilities, but rather, their strong fighting advantage against demons.
QUEST_20180629_009792	The Kingdom has always protected its people utilizing help from the divine Goddesses, talented Wizards, Clerics, and soldiers.{nl}And, one would think, in order to have leverage over demons, the societies of the Kingdom would also call upon the Exorcists to engage in battle.
QUEST_20180629_009793	However, in the Kingdom's history, Exorcists were often absent from such conflicts.{nl}In fact, Exorcists still gained the power to be of great assistance even without engaging.
QUEST_20180629_009794	One may think of this as a contradiction, just as when a healer, who has not treated any patients, still displays extraordinary clinical experience.
QUEST_20180629_009795	How the Exorcists achieved such ability to fight against demons, despite insufficient training, has to do with a secret agreement between the Goddesses and the demons.
QUEST_20180629_009796	The few clerics to become aware of this agreement learned about it through exorcism.{nl}They were able to identify the agreement due to a successful exorcism where the demon fled after being told it was harming the human it possessed. After researching the implications of such action, the agreement came to light.
QUEST_20180629_009797	To this day, it is still unclear as to why the Goddess and the demons have such an arrangement, but the effect is clear in the ease in which demons can now be exorcised.
QUEST_20180629_009798	It can be inferred from this development, that the Goddesses' formed an agreement with the demons with the intention of protecting us humans.
QUEST_20180629_009799	With that in mind, questioning or even misinterpreting their intentions is deemed inappropriate for a cleric. The important part is the result.{nl}This result is that those demons who, regardless of intention, wish to violate the Goddess-demon agreement and cause harm in our world can easily be punished by humans.
QUEST_20180629_009800	As Exorcists have been given the responsibility to deal with such matters, they have naturally gained superiority in combat against demons.{nl}Through their progress, they have provided valuable information about demons to the Sorcerers, Warlocks, Zealots, and other classes. And they have even provided materials, such as the occasional demon parts and cadavers, for experiments.
QUEST_20180629_009801	As a result, although it has only been recently that this agreement has come to light, Exorcists have contributed to keeping it alive by secretly ridding our world of those demons who wish to trespass it.
QUEST_20180629_009802	Take the time to carefully read the books on exorcism I gave to you.
QUEST_20180629_009803	It seems that you have finished studying.{nl}Now then, I shall test your knowledge of Exorcist theory.
QUEST_20180629_009804	It was Lomel II who propagated the organization of the Clerics' denominations.{nl}And the Exorcists were soon established as a part of the clergy.{nl}Can you tell me who were the people that were allowed to practice exorcisms and its related rituals at this point in history?
QUEST_20180629_009805	What is the proper way to deal with a divine spirit that is causing harm to a human?
QUEST_20180629_009806	Of the following, select all entities that can cause a possession.
QUEST_20180629_009807	What are evil spirits? 
QUEST_20180629_009808	You have studied the books well.{nl}You have passed the test.{nl}But I warn you, your next trial won't be as easy and is far more dangerous. 
QUEST_20180629_009809	Now you must steel your nerves.
QUEST_20180629_009810	Your knowledge of theory leaves much to be desired.{nl}Study a bit more.
QUEST_20180629_009811	We must now check if you are able to properly identify a possession.{nl}In a moment, a man will arrive who is claiming that he was forced to steal because he was possessed by an evil spirit.
QUEST_20180629_009812	You must decide for yourself whether he is truly possessed or not.
QUEST_20180629_009813	The man's name is Gintaras. Try interrogating him and come back to tell me whether you think he is truly possessed or not.
QUEST_20180629_009814	Gintaras
QUEST_20180629_009815	I did nothing wrong.{nl}The evil spirit inside of me forced me to do it.
QUEST_20180629_009816	If I was possessed, then I would have a fever?{nl}I can't tell if it's a fever or not but...{nl}Haha...
QUEST_20180629_009817	That's right.{nl}Can't you smell this awful stench?{nl}I can't bare it and I was worried it would cause problems for those around me.
QUEST_20180629_009818	I've heard some possessions don't give off such a smell, how unlucky am I...
QUEST_20180629_009819	You think that I purposely rubbed garbage on myself?{nl}That doesn't make any sense at all.{nl}I... I would never do such a thing.
QUEST_20180629_009820	Yes, that is correct.
QUEST_20180629_009821	At times I find myself soaking wet and at other times I was seen loitering near the Goddess Statue.
QUEST_20180629_009822	Ah...{nl}Did I really say that?
QUEST_20180629_009823	I can't remember a thing and the person who saw me may have been mistaken... 
QUEST_20180629_009824	What is that?{nl}Yikes!
QUEST_20180629_009825	It's so painful.{nl}Please release me from this pain.
QUEST_20180629_009826	Is that so?{nl}Maybe I reacted that way because I'm a bit sensitive to cold.
QUEST_20180629_009827	Did you say Gintaras is not a victim of possession?
QUEST_20180629_009828	You are correct.{nl}He has only feigning his possession to get himself out of trouble.
QUEST_20180629_009829	I really am possessed.{nl}I think I'm about to faint.{nl}Please exorcise me before the evil spirit takes over again.
QUEST_20180629_009830	Report to the Exorcist Master that Gintaras is not really possessed.
QUEST_20180629_009831	There has never been a case where a possession victim has not suffered from fever, so he is suspicious.
QUEST_20180629_009832	The possessed smell of a rotting corpse, not garbage.
QUEST_20180629_009833	Evil spirits cannot approach a Goddess Statue. He is suspicious.
QUEST_20180629_009834	He is surely not possessed because of his reaction to water.
QUEST_20180629_009835	There is a married couple who lives in the Spring Light Woods.{nl}The wife reported that she suspects her husband is possessed because he frequently suffers from a fever and memory loss.

QUEST_20180629_009837	Go to the Spring Light Woods and see if the husband is truly possessed or not.
QUEST_20180629_009838	Sygitas
QUEST_20180629_009839	I'm afraid that evil spirits might be possessing my body.{nl}What am I to do?
QUEST_20180629_009840	My body is always hot as fire from the fever.
QUEST_20180629_009841	Fevers are not a continual symptom in the case of possessions.
QUEST_20180629_009842	I sweat a lot because of the fever.{nl}I need to change frequently because of the smell of sweat.
QUEST_20180629_009843	The possessed smell like rotting corpses, not sweat.
QUEST_20180629_009844	When the fever gets too high I often collapse and suffer from memory loss.
QUEST_20180629_009845	The possessed do not have memory of the time they are possessed, but there have been no reports of victims collapsing.
QUEST_20180629_009846	Whoa... It's freezing...
QUEST_20180629_009847	He doesn't seem to have the same reaction that most victims have to water.
QUEST_20180629_009848	There isn't enough evidence to tell if he is possessed or not. Let's investigate further.
QUEST_20180629_009849	Rimanta
QUEST_20180629_009850	What am I to do if my husband is possessed by an evil spirit?{nl}I am sick with worry.
QUEST_20180629_009851	His fever wasn't this bad just a few days ago.{nl}At first I thought he was sick so I got him some medicine.
QUEST_20180629_009852	But the medicine only seemed to make the fever worse and he started fainting despite all the different medicine we've tried.
QUEST_20180629_009853	His fever doesn't seem as serious as the fever the possessed suffer from.
QUEST_20180629_009854	He sweats profusely because of his fever.{nl}So I have to change his clothes and sheets all the time because of the smell of sweat.
QUEST_20180629_009855	It seems that he reeks of sweat and not rotting corpses.
QUEST_20180629_009856	He collapses and starts speaking in tongues when his fever gets too high.
QUEST_20180629_009857	Check to see if he shows other symptoms than speaking in tongues.
QUEST_20180629_009858	I wake him up when he does that but he doesn't seem to remember it at all.
QUEST_20180629_009859	I didn't notice anything else about his behavior, just his gibberish.
QUEST_20180629_009860	There seem to be no other symptoms.
QUEST_20180629_009861	It may be just a fever. Let's investigate further.
QUEST_20180629_009862	There are some food supplies in the box but they look spoilt.
QUEST_20180629_009863	The water smells funny.
QUEST_20180629_009864	There's some noxious smelling liquor in the barrel. 
QUEST_20180629_009865	It may be that he is just sick from eating spoilt food.
QUEST_20180629_009866	Do you think my husband is possessed by an evil spirit?
QUEST_20180629_009867	Yes, we did eat the food in the boxes.{nl}Why do you ask?
QUEST_20180629_009868	Are you saying that my husband became sick from eating the spoilt food?{nl}And he just gradually got worse because he wasn't treated in time?{nl}What can I do to cure my husband?
QUEST_20180629_009869	Report to the Exorcist Master about the couple.
QUEST_20180629_009870	So the husband was sick from eating spoilt food and his condition grew worse because it wasn't treated in time.{nl}I am relieved to hear that he wasn't possessed but it sounds like he's desperately in need of help.
QUEST_20180629_009871	Tell the Plague Doctor Master about the sick husband for help.
QUEST_20180629_009872	Plague Doctor Master
QUEST_20180629_009873	It saddens me to hear that there are people who must survive on spoilt food.{nl}I will give you a prescription for a medicine that can cure him.
QUEST_20180629_009874	This should be enough for both husband and wife so please deliver this to them.

QUEST_20180629_009879	Thank you for your help.
QUEST_20180629_009880	What will I ever do if my husband dies?
QUEST_20180629_009881	Thank you for helping my husband get better...{nl}I will be more careful in the future not to eat spoilt food.
QUEST_20180629_009882	Let's return to the Exorcist Master.
QUEST_20180629_009883	A man named Zigmas is claiming he is possessed.{nl}Go and investigate whether he is really possessed or not.
QUEST_20180629_009884	Go and investigate whether Zigmas is really possessed or not.
QUEST_20180629_009885	Zigmas
QUEST_20180629_009886	I need help.{nl}A strange man torments me in my dreams every night.{nl}When I awake the next day I find that people around me are hurt.
QUEST_20180629_009887	Before the nightmare I suffer from an intense fever.{nl}When I finally fall asleep the strange man appears and torments me.{nl}Just the sight of him paralyzes my body so I can't get away from him.
QUEST_20180629_009888	Zigmas has a fever and sees a strange man in his dreams.
QUEST_20180629_009889	Others tell me that I sleepwalk and wave my fists in the air as if assaulting someone.{nl}They say that whenever I am sleepwalking it smells like a rotting corpse.{nl}I think this happens when I am suffering in my dreams.
QUEST_20180629_009890	He mentioned the smell of a rotting corpse.
QUEST_20180629_009891	All I can remember is what happened in my dream.{nl}I find out that I've hurt someone when I awake but I don't have any memory of it. 
QUEST_20180629_009892	He has no memory of hurting anyone.
QUEST_20180629_009893	What is it that you sprayed on me?{nl}It feels like my skin is burning!{nl}It hurts!
QUEST_20180629_009894	He has strong reactions to Holy Water.
QUEST_20180629_009895	There is no doubt he is possessed. Let's tell the Exorcist Master.
QUEST_20180629_009896	Very good. He is indeed possessed.
QUEST_20180629_009897	Let's move on to the next step.
QUEST_20180629_009898	Next, we will see you in action.{nl}There is a nightmare-inducing orb on the outskirts of Fedimian.{nl}Investigation by Exorcists has shown that the orb is possessed by an evil spirit.
QUEST_20180629_009899	Go and exorcise the evil spirits.{nl}All the items that you need for an exorcism are written on this parchment.
QUEST_20180629_009900	Read the parchment carefully and prepare yourself.
QUEST_20180629_009901	Exorcist Master's Parchment
QUEST_20180629_009902	Evil spirits are weak against all things holy and will do anything in their power to get away from them.{nl}It is recommended that you purify the surroundings before proceeding with the ritual.{nl}Spray Holy Water and burn Gyslotis to purify your surroundings, and arrange Blessed Goddess Statues around you to weaken the evil spirit.{nl}Obtain all the necessary items before you proceed.
QUEST_20180629_009903	You can get the Gyslotis and Holy Water from the Priest Master.{nl}Then ask for the Dievdirbys Master's help in making a Blessed Goddess Statue and you will be ready.
QUEST_20180629_009904	A Blessed Goddess Statue? For an exorcism?
QUEST_20180629_009905	Then I will need some Topaz Fragments to build it.{nl}I don't need too many, I just need 12 fragments.
QUEST_20180629_009906	That is enough Topaz Fragments.
QUEST_20180629_009907	You've collected the Topaz Fragments.{nl}Give them to me?{nl}I'll make the statue for you right away.
QUEST_20180629_009908	Here you go.{nl}Use the Blessed Goddess Statue to exorcise the evil spirits.
QUEST_20180629_009909	The orb is afloat mid-air, emanating a dizzyingly ominous energy.
QUEST_20180629_009910	Ominous Orb
QUEST_20180629_009911	The orb is afloat mid-air, emanating a dizzyingly ominous energy.
QUEST_20180629_009912	I feel ready. I'll proceed with the exorcism.
QUEST_20180629_009913	It seems the preparations were out of order. The curse of the evil spirits is strong.
QUEST_20180629_009914	The ritual can't continue due to the evil spirits' curse.
QUEST_20180629_009915	Hallowventers emerged from the ominous orb.
QUEST_20180629_009916	Defeated all the Hallowventers.
QUEST_20180629_009917	You have completed an exorcism.{nl}At last, you have qualified to become an Exorcist.
QUEST_20180629_009918	First, gain the approval of the Krivis Master, the Priest Master, and the Inquisitor Master.
QUEST_20180629_009919	As an Exorcist, you must be aware that you could also fall under demonic possession at any time.{nl}Evil spirits will jump at the first chance they see to possess our souls.
QUEST_20180629_009920	Since Medzio Diena, it seems that those who could not be saved by the grace of the Goddess are becoming evil spirits.{nl}It saddens me to think that there is no salvation for them.
QUEST_20180629_009921	I was in dire need of help...{nl}Thank the Goddess you're here.
QUEST_20180629_009922	One day I noticed that a new obelisk appeared in the forest.{nl}Since then, the monsters grew more violent and began attacking the shelter in groups.
QUEST_20180629_009923	We've evacuated all the women and children and gathered the able men to defend the shelter.{nl}But it was beyond our power to run the invading monsters out of the shelter.
QUEST_20180629_009924	I thank you sincerely for your help.{nl}Let's go to where the refugees are.
QUEST_20180629_009925	I began spotting new monsters in Mishekan Forest since a couple of days ago.{nl}I did not give it much mind because such things were commonplace since Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20180629_009926	I should never have let it pass.{nl}These monsters were extremely violent and they wanted to destroy our lives.
QUEST_20180629_009927	I lead an investigation to find out where they were coming from and found that they entered the forest through some kind of a portal.{nl}The Akhlass that arrived through the portal built an obelisk which strengthened the monsters.
QUEST_20180629_009928	We tried to handle the situation by destroying the obelisk and reinforcing defense plans, but the obelisk was quickly rebuilt and our plans were outsmarted.
QUEST_20180629_009929	Please destroy the portal so that the monsters can't attack our village.
QUEST_20180629_009930	We were in such a desolate state before you came.{nl}I can't fight the monsters myself, but I can help.
QUEST_20180629_009931	If you bring me some sacks I can make some bombs for you.
QUEST_20180629_009932	Please defend our village.
QUEST_20180629_009933	I saw Nagles when he was hurt while defending the shelter from the monsters.{nl}I'm afraid that I might suffer the same fate.
QUEST_20180629_009934	Here you go.{nl}Please defend our village from the monsters.
QUEST_20180629_009935	We lived here for over 3 years.{nl}This shelter is like a home to us.{nl}Please stop the monsters from ruining our lives.
QUEST_20180629_009936	I first found the portal on the path heading right from Pavojingas Lot.{nl}Later, I found more portals in Agresyvus and Saughus Lots.
QUEST_20180629_009937	We tried destroying the portals ourselves but the monsters were too strong.
QUEST_20180629_009938	The obelisk is in the area further past the Phavegheliai Farmland, Atstumas Pond and Preivhengikas Felled Area.
QUEST_20180629_009939	Only the Akhlass will be at Atstumas Pond but in the rest of the areas there are strange objects.
QUEST_20180629_009940	There are floating crystals near the obelisk in Preivhengikas Felled Area that follow you and shoot lightening.{nl}And there are orbs in Phavegheliai Farmland that explode when you touch them.{nl}These objects are so powerful that even the monsters are killed off by them.
QUEST_20180629_009941	We destroyed the obelisk but it was rebuilt within a minute.{nl}It was as if the obelisks were sharing some sort of a regenerating energy between them.
QUEST_20180629_009942	Nobody gave any thought when Wekin's reported seeing monsters that were never before seen in the Mishekan Forest.{nl}It's because such things are so commonplace these days.
QUEST_20180629_009943	Looking back at it now, we should have listened.
QUEST_20180629_009944	We spotted some new monsters in Pavojingas Lot and Mishekan Forest.{nl}I thought the whole world was going mad.
QUEST_20180629_009945	More and more monsters started appearing in Mishekan Forest.{nl}We thought it was strange so we investigated it to find that monsters were arriving through a portal.
QUEST_20180629_009946	At first they didn't do us any harm so we paid it no mind, but soon they started attacking the shelter in small numbers, then in groups.{nl}We tried to stop them on our own but we couldn't.
QUEST_20180629_009947	Soon after the portals were found, the skin of monsters in Mishekan Forest grew harder.{nl}Their skin also became poisonous.{nl}When I went to Mishekan Forest to investigate I saw some Akhlass building an obelisk.{nl}I suspected that the obelisk was what caused the monsters to become stronger so I blew it up with a bomb.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009948	But after a minute, the obelisk was regenerated.
QUEST_20180629_009949	Us refugees joined forces to destroy all the obelisks we could find, but that didn't stop the obelisks from regenerating.{nl}Curtis said that he thinks if there is at least one obelisk remaining all the destroyed obelisks would regenerate.
QUEST_20180629_009950	{nl}Because of what he said, we planned to destroy all obelisks simultaneously but we couldn't because the monsters started to attack our shelter.
QUEST_20180629_009951	Try to destroy all the obelisks at once.
QUEST_20180629_009952	I was hurt while defending the shelter from monsters so I cannot move.{nl}I can't fight the monsters myself but I can help.
QUEST_20180629_009953	If you bring me sacks I will build for you ballistas, turrets and other devices that will help with the defense.
QUEST_20180629_009954	I saw this coming.{nl}I asked for help from Fedimian, Orsha and Klaipeda but they all ignored us.{nl}They practically abandoned us.
QUEST_20180629_009955	Curtis, oblivious to the situation, kept saying that we should wait for reinforcements to arrive...{nl}But I knew from the start that we are all going to die.
QUEST_20180629_009956	We had enough food to be self-sufficient so I didn't think there would be a problem but now that monsters are attacking there is no hope for us.
QUEST_20180629_009957	Everyone is doing their best to defend the shelter but there's only so much we can do without the help from soldiers.
QUEST_20180629_009958	I knew that one day this life would come to an end, but it is hard to accept now that it actually is.
QUEST_20180629_009959	Frostbites, monsters, food...{nl}Everything around us seems to be a threat.
QUEST_20180629_009960	I want to show Salewya that there is still hope.{nl}I won't let the monsters take over this shelter.
QUEST_20180629_009961	Ah, Revelator...{nl}The herbalist just told me a strange rumor.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009962	Some soldiers were spotted being lead someplace by someone near Nheto Forest.{nl}They say that the soldiers were acting a bit funny.
QUEST_20180629_009963	It was just a rumor I heard so... I don't have the details.{nl}But if this turns out to be true, I am afraid that the soldiers might be in trouble.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009964	The person who was leading the soldiers didn't seem like a general.{nl}And the soldiers were acting a bit strange so...{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009965	Could you investigate Nheto Forest for me?{nl}You may find some evidence regarding the incident.
QUEST_20180629_009966	Search the Pjama Resting Place in Nheto Forest.{nl}They say that the soldiers were spotted passing the area.
QUEST_20180629_009967	I do hope it's nothing serious.{nl}It's just a rumor after all.
QUEST_20180629_009968	Just as you've said, Revelator. It could just be a rumor or an exaggeration.
QUEST_20180629_009969	Head to the Pjama Resting Place in Nheto Forest.
QUEST_20180629_009970	Someone is sitting there.
QUEST_20180629_009971	The man seems to be in a bewildered state.{nl}Could he be related to the rumors? It's best to try and talk to him again.
QUEST_20180629_009972	The man seems to not hear anything.{nl}Try a different method?
QUEST_20180629_009973	Arvydas
QUEST_20180629_009974	Hmm... Is that why you came to this place?{nl}The rumors you've heard are true.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009975	I was being lead somewhere by someone along with all the other soldiers.{nl}I remember hearing a tune from a flute which mesmerized us...{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009976	Well, I fell out of the group so I have no idea where the other soldiers are.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009977	Aw... My head's beginning to hurt again.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009978	I... I want to ask you if you could tell Commander Vacenin about this?{nl}My name is Alwedas.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009979	I was under Commander Vacenin's command once, so he should remember me.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009980	And... And please tell him to come get me out of here.{nl}I beg of you.
QUEST_20180629_009981	Please tell Commander Vacenin about all of this and ask him to get me out of here.{nl}Ouch... My head is hurting again...
QUEST_20180629_009982	Go to Commander Vacenin at the entrance of Kateen Forest and tell him about the situation.
QUEST_20180629_009983	Arvydas was an able soldier who used to be under my command.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009984	We used to keep in contact after he was transferred to the Fallen City but he stopped corresponding...{nl}Now I know why...{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009985	I will send some soldiers to rescue Arvydas.{nl}However... I am concerned about the mention of the sound of flutes.{nl} 
QUEST_20180629_009986	Do you know about the Pied Piper Master?{nl}He is a man of legendary renown when it comes to flutes.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009987	I assume that this incident may have something to do with the Pied Piper Master.{nl}Why don't you go pay him a visit to see if he knows anything?
QUEST_20180629_009988	I do not know his whereabouts, as the Pied Piper Master is known to wander from place to place.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009989	Perhaps the Oracle Master knows where he is, so go consult with the Oracle Master in Klaipeda.
QUEST_20180629_009990	If you insist.{nl}I will find someone else for the job.
QUEST_20180629_009991	The Oracle Master in Klaipeda will know where the Pied Piper Master is.{nl}If you do find the Pied Piper Master, ask him if he knows anything regarding the incident.
QUEST_20180629_009992	Visit the Oracle Master in Klaipeda to ask where the Pied Piper Master could be.
QUEST_20180629_009993	You've come.{nl}I knew that you would come to see me.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009994	Could I ask you why you are looking for the Pied Piper Master?
QUEST_20180629_009995	I see.{nl}The Pied Piper Master is involved in quite a large number of incidents.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009996	You should be able to find him in the Forest of Prayer.
QUEST_20180629_009997	I almost forgot. Take this with you.{nl}This note contains the location of the Pied Piper Master just in case you forget.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_009998	You will be asked to do many tasks once you meet the Pied Piper Master.{nl}You accomplish the tasks much more easily if you keep a track of the given tasks on this note. 
QUEST_20180629_009999	The Piped Piper Master is in the Forest of Prayer.{nl}His location is in the note I gave you.{nl}You can also keep a track of the tasks that he will give you on the note.
QUEST_20180629_010000	Pied Piper Master
QUEST_20180629_010001	You've come to see me?{nl}It's been quite a while since I had a visitor.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010002	Could you tell me what you wanted to see me for?
QUEST_20180629_010003	There have been rumors about this...{nl}This is my fault.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010004	I will not deny that I have something to do with the said rumors.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010005	You may not know, but I have apprentices all over the lands.{nl}The rumor you speak of has to do with a very talented apprentice of mine.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010006	The soldiers in the area suffered from some kind of a mental breakdown so that disciple came to me for help.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010007	Leaving the soldiers in their current state...{nl}It would have been dangerous for both the soldiers and the people around them.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010008	It was I, along with my apprentice, that lead the soldiers through the forest in order to prevent such a thing from happening.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010009	The soldiers are mentally unstable so I cannot tell you where they are in their current state.{nl}They are like a ticking time bomb.
QUEST_20180629_010010	You may not know but I have apprentices all over the lands.{nl}The rumor you speak of has to do with a very talented apprentice of mine named Ejuidas.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010011	I have heard stories about you, the Revelator, through Eivydas.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010012	As you already know, the soldiers are mentally unstable.{nl}Eivydas realized that the task was too big for him and came to me to seek help.{nl}
QUEST_20180629_010013	It was I, along with Eivydas, that lead the soldiers through the forest in order to prevent such a thing from happening.{nl}

QUEST_20180827_010154	We're in the process of creating a few bases and assembly areas along the way to the Starlit Lake.{nl}Our troops are traveling along the same route, but they each have different destinations.{nl}If anything happens while the troops are moving, that could really set us back.

QUEST_20180827_010156	Our troops may not be fighting together with the resistance, but we've been keeping the demons from joining Ignas in the battle.{nl}That way Byle doesn't have to worry about Ignas' side getting support from the outside.

QUEST_20180827_010224	No more arrows on this side.{nl}Now we need to clear out this evil energy.
QUEST_20180827_010225	Yes, of course. The fact that you made it here means you disabled all the traps on the way.{nl}Now I and those who come after me can go back in safety.
QUEST_20180827_010226	Understood. That will let us stop all the protection devices and turn off the defenses.
QUEST_20180827_010227	I'm glad we don't need to worry about those traps anymore.{nl}Now we can focus on the operation.
QUEST_20180827_010228	You've defeated Cezaris! Have you found his key?{nl}

QUEST_20180827_010238	Your journey was arduous and exhausting, I am sure.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010239	Alas, there is nowhere to go from here. This is where you must die.

QUEST_20180827_010241	Here you are, Henika!{nl}You despicable man, what are you trying to do this time!?
QUEST_20180827_010242	All that toxic smoke outside, was that you!?{nl}Do you know how many of our members are suffering because of you!?
QUEST_20180827_010243	So you came, Byle. Yes... Many of them perished...{nl}Don't you see, it was all in the name of Ignas' noble cause!{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010244	Dare to resist and you too will die!
QUEST_20180827_010245	You've lost your mind, Henika...{nl}That demon in disguise deserves to pay for his crimes!
QUEST_20180827_010246	Attention!{nl}Henika is conspiring against our allies and he's now attempting to escape!
QUEST_20180827_010247	Pursue him! But be cautious! We don't know what he could have done.{nl}He's holding information, so it's crucial that we capture him alive. Now go! After him!
QUEST_20180827_010248	Revelator, Henika is pure evil.{nl}I don't know what else he'll do if we leave him be!{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010249	I'm sending our soldiers out to track him.{nl}Meanwhile, I need you to eliminate the demons he summoned.
QUEST_20180827_010250	You're here... I'm sorry. The energy is too strong, it's hard to even move.{nl}The same is happening to our members... We can't give up yet...
QUEST_20180827_010251	I heard of you. Do not be startled.{nl}I am Adaux, Elder of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010252	I heard whispers coming from Henika's key. Your voices.{nl}It seems you too have been taken by the evil energy.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010253	This energy Ignas released after your attack, it will not let me move.{nl}Do you not need to stop Ignas?{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010254	Allow me to make a proposal. I will tell you the way to disable his defenses.{nl}Instead, you must help me escape from the Astral Tower.
QUEST_20180827_010255	Are you suggesting we even consider this questionable proposal?
QUEST_20180827_010256	Yes... I understand you have reasons to distrust me.{nl}But I am different. I am not Henika, the owner of that key, who so foolishly followed Ignas.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010257	I have no desire for power. I convinced the Elders and became an informant to Ignas.{nl}But Ignas – he made a pact with the demons and turned the lives of the Schaffenstar, the Elders, and even himself...{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010258	He turned us all into monsters for his own cause.
QUEST_20180827_010259	Wait. You say he turned you into monsters... Do you mean...?
QUEST_20180827_010260	So it is. Our deranged leader turned us all into demons.{nl}Myself and my subordinates suffered the same fate.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010261	The few members who have escaped Ignas' power are now by my side.{nl}You may not trust me, but I ask that you have the mercy to help them.
QUEST_20180827_010262	Aid us in our escape and I will tell you about what is happening in the Tower, and what you must do.{nl}We are prepared to abandon the Tower and never return.
QUEST_20180827_010263	Revelator, Adaux's proposal seems far too uncertain. But on the other hand...{nl}As it is, we have close to no information on what is happening inside the Tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010264	There could be more to Henika's plans besides the smoke traps.{nl}If I'm being honest, I believe this is all a plot by Henika. But if we wait any longer, we may just find ourselves with our hands completely tied.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010265	For now, I think we ought to do as he says and remain alert.
QUEST_20180827_010266	Listen closely.{nl}Ignas installed the demons' machines near the observatory on 21F.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010267	I do not know how the machines are operated.{nl}All I can tell is that they transformed people of the Schaffenstar into demons.
QUEST_20180827_010268	I believe the devices will produce an energy close to the one that is now spreading near us.{nl}As long as those machines are active, they will keep transforming those inside the Astral Tower into demons.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010269	They must be stopped.{nl}If not, you too will slowly become demented and transform into a demon.
QUEST_20180827_010270	I am late in my regret, I know. I can only hope to escape and spend the rest of my days in repent.{nl}Byle, I believe you have my key.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010271	There is much to gather yet.{nl}But I faith in you.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010272	As a guilty man, it may not be my place to say this.{nl}But I must ask for your help.
QUEST_20180827_010273	Reclaim the Astral Tower, rid us of our suffering.
QUEST_20180827_010274	That is what we are here for.{nl}To take back the holy Astral Tower from its corrupt leader.
QUEST_20180827_010275	Adaux trusted me with a key.{nl}He said we would need it to enter the 21F observatory where Ignas is stationed.
QUEST_20180827_010276	He explained the way to deactivate the defense mechanisms on 20F.{nl}He also told me how to make our way to 20F and 21F.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010277	I would like to share that information with you first.
QUEST_20180827_010278	Ignas, you despicable man! You sacrificed your own people for power??
QUEST_20180827_010279	Head of the Schaffenstar Ignas
QUEST_20180827_010280	Well, well. If it isn't the Resistance Commander.{nl}I'm surprised you made it this far.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010281	The question is: can you go any further?
QUEST_20180827_010282	Hahahah, you call that an attack?{nl}I feel sorry for you, Commander, underestimating me with an attack like that.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010283	Know your place.{nl}I'm not exactly someone you want to be picking a fight with.
QUEST_20180827_010284	You need to know what's good for you!
QUEST_20180827_010285	Elder Henika was caught by your people. Elder Adaux turned his back and betrayed me.{nl}Elder Cezaris, killed by your futile schemes...
QUEST_20180827_010286	This was all your fault.{nl}Everything that's happened to us, down to the fact that your dirty troops were even allowed in here!{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010287	Revelator or not, it was you who ruined every one of my plans!!{nl}But not for much longer. This is where you die, once and for all!
QUEST_20180827_010288	At last, the day for which I have waited for over a thousand years is near.{nl}Soon I will come to you; not as an apparition or a mere image, but as my true self.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010289	I have shared the pain of the countless keepers whose lives were sacrificed in my name.{nl}Savior, it won't be long now before your efforts bring to fruition our millenary endeavor.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010290	I will not rush to declare victory.{nl}However, I trust that with you by our side the sacrifices of the keepers will not have been in vain.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010291	Alas, I'm afraid that our actions, whatever they may be, will always result in another unfortunate sacrifice: that of my sister Giltine.{nl}What's more, our battle will not end with her demise.
QUEST_20180827_010292	Giltine is not the sole goddess amongst the demons.{nl}There exist five other deities below her, serving her.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010293	After Giltine is defeated, a war with the five Demon Gods will begin.{nl}The final Revelation rests at the place which for eras was at the center of the human Kingdom, 
QUEST_20180827_010294	. That is where we shall face the enemy, in a battle that will both end and start it all.
QUEST_20180827_010295	There's something shiny nearby. Go closer and have a look.
QUEST_20180827_010296	I was waiting for you.{nl}I'm relieved to see you arrive in safety.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010297	In order to move to the next area, you must find a secret code.{nl}I wish I had more time to explain, but carrying out the plan successfully is of utmost priority.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010298	Look around. There is a path leading to two different rooms that is not the path you took here.{nl}The path leads to the rooms below and to the library on the right.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010299	Look for clues in both locations and use them on the pillars standing behind me.{nl}If you decipher the code, a portal will open.{nl}

QUEST_20180827_010307	The room below tells you which color of bookmark to place on which pillar.{nl}In the room you will see 4 magic cores and demons roaming in the center.
QUEST_20180827_010308	The demons in the center possess a power different from that of other demons.{nl}You will be able to differentiate them by their appearance.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010309	Use each of the types of magic core to attract the demons in the center.{nl}The cores will absorb the demons and gain their magic power.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010310	Repeat this several times with all the magic cores to obtain the information you need.{nl}Once a core is full, it will give out a signal. When you see it, approach the magic core.
QUEST_20180827_010311	The library on the right contains a reading desk and 25 different bookshelves.{nl}First, go near the desk and check the numbers inscribed in it.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010312	Those numbers will tell you what you need to know.{nl}Decipher the meaning of the numbers and search the bookshelves accordingly.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010313	Search the correct bookshelves and you will obtain a series of bookmarks.{nl}Once you have collected them all, place them on the pillars in the correct order.

QUEST_20180827_010317	To understand the code, go to the room below.{nl}There you will find clues to the correct order of the bookmarks.
QUEST_20180827_010318	Please select a topic.

QUEST_20180827_010353	For the first time since the attainment of autonomy by the Schaffenstar during the reign of King Barynwell, a serious conflict with an external territory has arisen.{nl}This conflict has now been duly solved through the use of reason. However, for the purpose of preventing similar incidents in the future history of the Schaffenstar, all members have agreed to establish a set of distinct, inviolable rules.{nl}They are as follows.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010354	One. Any individual found to be violating Royal Law within Schaffestar territory shall be detained and promptly entrusted to the corresponding authorities, regardless of their position or lack thereof within the Schaffenstar.{nl}This rule will not apply to formerly convicted criminals whose sentence has been completed.{nl}Two. Should the violation occur not to the Royal Law but to local regulations, the decision on whether to release the criminal shall lie with the head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}If the individual is considered inculpable, those at the Schaffenstar will protect them unconditionally.{nl}Any expenses derived from such an incident shall be charged to the territory or noble family involved.
QUEST_20180827_010355	Three. The Starlit Lake, the Astral Tower, and the Schaffenstar constitute a self-governing society recognized as such by Royal Law. This society follows the tradition of the Great Lydia Schaffen in the protection of the goddesses and the Kingdom.{nl}Therefore, all other territories and noble families are to cooperate with the Schaffenstar and surrender to us, at no cost, any criminal considered so by our regulations.{nl}If the territory's authority does not comply with this condition, those responsible for it shall be punished accordingly.{nl}All lords and nobles of the Kingdom are to respect the aforementioned rules with no exceptions.{nl}

QUEST_20180827_010360	Frequent visits by non-members of the Schaffenstar for matters related to the work of the Masters force visitors to endure long journeys to the Tower, and place on our members the burden of continuously entertaining the guests.{nl}While we admire and support the noble endeavors of our Masters, in order to avoid further inconveniences, we have agreed to apply as of this day the following rules.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010361	One. Any Schaffenstar member who ascends to the position of Class Master shall have their status altered to honorary member and be forbidden from practicing their Master duties within the Astral Tower.{nl}

Honorary members shall be considered as legitimate constituents of the Shaffenstar, and they shall be duly revered as such.{nl}Should an honorary member retire from their position as Master, they shall be allowed the status of Elder of the Schaffenstar.{nl}In the event of death, any honorary member shall be granted the posthumous status of Elder, unless expressed otherwise.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010363	Three. During their service as Masters, honorary members will not be granted authority in official matters concerning the Schaffenstar.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010364	Four. During their service as Masters, honorary members will not receive the benefits and compensation attributed to Schaffenstar members.{nl}Instead, any sum corresponding to salaries, pensions, etc. shall be accumulated at and managed by the Schaffenstar. The total will then be conferred to the Master upon their return to the Astral Tower.
QUEST_20180827_010365	Annex 1. Archer tree Class Masters not originating from the Schaffenstar may, if they so wish, apply to the status of honorary member at the organization under these same rules.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010366	Annex 2. The aforementioned rules will also apply to Schaffenstar members who ascend to the position of Master of a class not in the Archer tree.
QUEST_20180827_010367	Rules Concerning the Status of Schaffenstar Members
QUEST_20180827_010368	* Rules Concerning the Status of Schaffenstar Members{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010369	One. Should a member of the Schaffenstar wish to serve as a public official of the Kingdom or in the Royal Army, they are required to alert the head of the organization before the application is submitted.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010370	Two. Unless a violation of Royal Law is committed, such members shall maintain their rights and duties as constituents of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010371	Three. Contrary to article two of this document, should a member be appointed to a position above that of Head of the Schaffenstar, they shall receive the status of honorary member.{nl}They shall be duly revered as high officials of the Kingdom, as are other honorary members.{nl}As of this date, this rule applies to Schaffenstar members currently serving in the position of Chancellor and General.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010372	Four. Members of the Royal Family who become part of the Schaffenstar shall receive no special treatment.{nl}However, should they be appointed to one of the higher positions mentioned by article three of this document, they too shall receive proper reverence as honorary members of the organization.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010373	Five. The Schaffenstar shall not differentiate members based on their social status or background.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010374	Six. Members shall not receive orders from lords or nobles without permission from the Head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}Should a member accept such an order in a situation where it cannot be reported, that order may be canceled if it is later opposed by the Head of the Schaffenstar.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010375	Seven. Members are required to prioritize orders commanded by the Head of the Schaffenstar over those originating from lords and nobles external to the organization.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010376	Eight. The same rules described in the articles above shall apply to duties and authorities originating from Cleric organizations and orders.{nl}This excludes, however, commands directly enacted by the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010377	Nine. Cases where none of the aforementioned rules apply shall be judged by the Head of the Schaffenstar.
QUEST_20180827_010378	The Schaffenstar Code of Conduct (Excerpt)
QUEST_20180827_010379	* The Schaffenstar Code of Conduct (Excerpt){nl}
QUEST_20180827_010380	No. 125: Visits to the highest floors of the Tower and access to the telescopes must be supervised by an Elder, or any member of equal or superior status.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010381	No. 126: Offensive devices aimed at the lower floors must be repaired and maintained under the supervision of an Elder, or any member of equal or superior status.{nl}Members on the lower floors must be alerted a minimum of 1 hour prior to any operation, and all lower floors must be completely evacuated in advance.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010382	No. 127: Impeding access to elevators is forbidden in situations of war or preparation for battle.{nl}In cases of emergency, elevators may be disabled or destroyed.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010383	No. 128: Trainee members must remain cautious not to temper with the Water Facilities when cleaning or performing other tasks at the lake.{nl}

QUEST_20180827_010387	Schaffenstar Confidential Documents
QUEST_20180827_010388	* Schaffenstar Confidential Documents{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010389	Access to the following documents is restricted to the Head of the Schaffenstar and authorized persons only.{nl}If found, please return to the Head of the Schaffenstar immediately.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010390	The present document serves to record and categorize confidential information kept by the Heads of the Schaffenstar since Lydia Schaffen, founder and first leader of the organization.{nl}My intent is to preserve in written form the information that has for centuries been passed on exclusively through oral tradition. This will ensure the conservation of our secrets to future leaders of the Schaffenstar in the event of my unexpected death or other unfortunate events.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010391	As it would be dangerous to compile all the information in a single document, it is my goal to divide it into chapters and hide each document in a secret location of the tower.{nl}I ask future leaders of the Schaffenstar that they, too, keep these confidential documents hidden in that manner.{nl}Should the position of head of the organization continue to be passed on through oral tradition, I predict there will be no need to consult the hidden documents.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010392	The next Head of the Schaffenstar, should they ascend to their position in a manner that is unconventional, may not be aware of these secret locations. However, I am certain that they will be able to discover them through the process of their initiation in the role.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010393	Confidential: It is a well-known fact that Lydia Schaffen defeated the great demon Ziburynas and sent another demon by the name of Rumpelstiltskin to the Moon.{nl}Schaffen was not aware of it at the time, but her heroic achievements would produce a significant impact in the hierarchical order of the demonic world.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010394	Lydia Schaffen was the first human to ever become involved in a major power shift of the demonic world, with her actions triggering a full-scale crisis in the demon realm.{nl}The one referred to in ancient texts as the Beholder suffered a significant blow to his status, and while Giltine herself may have remained unscathed, several demons serving her were also severely affected.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010395	The details of how the death of a demon lord and the disappearance of Rumpelstiltskin affected the position of several lower-ranked demons remain unknown.{nl}What we know for certain is that those events gave way to a period of serious turbulence in the demons' hierarchical systems.{nl}This shift provides the background information we need to understand the future actions of three demons in particular.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010396	They are Demon Goddess Ragana, Demon Lord Baiga and Demon Lord Hauberk. Little is known about them, but we have reasons to believe that they will attempt to act contrarily to demon traditions.{nl}This, of course, does not mean that they will act in favor of humans, which is why our society must remain vigilant of the actions of these demons who are at the center of the upheaval.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010397	17th Head of the Schaffenstar{nl}Gaikang Mcen
QUEST_20180827_010398	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 1
QUEST_20180827_010399	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 1{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010400	Demon Lord Solcomm is and will remain unable to successfully attack the Astral Tower by force after its completion.{nl}This statement is supported by the records that follow.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010401	Solcomm's first step was to gather demon forces in large numbers.{nl}The area just beyond the tower's defense range is entirely covered by demons and monsters.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010402	Transporting a large number of demons into the human realm is no easy task, which is causing a gap between the arrival of each offensive group.{nl}This, of course, is advantageous to the Schaffenstar.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010403	More advantageous still is being under the command of Lydia Schaffen, who is widely known as a prolific conqueror of demons.{nl}At last, with the construction of the Astral Tower complete, we can stand against the demons.{nl}It is time to prove to them that we are not a target to underestimate.
QUEST_20180827_010404	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 2
QUEST_20180827_010405	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 2{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010406	The first day of battle.{nl}Members of the Schaffenstar were outside scraping the bottom of the lake when a group of demons breached the tower's range of defense in a sudden attack.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010407	The sentinels atop the tower sounded the alarm.{nl}Approaching the tower unseen is virtually impossible in favorable weather conditions.{nl}Not only that, the lake rarely attracts the formation of fog.{nl}That is, in fact, one of the reasons why our leader chose this location for the construction of the tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010408	Upon hearing the alarm, the members working on the lake immediately collected their tools and returned to the tower.{nl}From far away, the members would have looked as if they were standing atop the surface of the water, as was usual.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010409	They ran towards the tower, calm and composed. Naturally so, as all members had received prior training.{nl}The early alarm allowed those working outside to enter the tower in time to prevent the demons' attack from succeeding.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010410	Instead, the first casualties happened on the side of the demons.{nl}As their front line came into contact with the lake, the water began to react.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010411	Our side did not need to fire a single arrow.{nl}The effects were varied.{nl}Some demons burned, some melted, yet others hardened into rock.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010412	The demons had been unaware of this mechanism, as it would have been impossible for them to perform any sort of reconnaissance on the lake without a response from the tower's defenses.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010413	Eventually, Solcomm commanded the first group to retreat.{nl}Though we took no significant action, it was a sure victory for the Schaffenstar. 
QUEST_20180827_010414	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 3
QUEST_20180827_010415	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 3{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010416	Despite our ballista attacks, one demon managed to soar over the tower and return to the demons' camp alive.{nl}The injuries caused to its wings were not enough to shoot it down into the water.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010417	Today, the demons prepared a fleet of ships for another attack.{nl}How they obtained such a large number of vessels remains unknown.{nl}It seems the demons are more resourceful than we previously thought.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010418	We waited for the demons to approach the tower aboard their ships.{nl}Once they were near enough for us to distinguish their features, we launched our attack.{nl}There was no need for absolute accuracy, as even the slightest contact with water from the lake provoked a reaction in them.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010419	Our projectiles bore holes into their vessels, allowing the water to seep in and cause damage.{nl}The demons were unable to drain the water out of the ships, as that would expose them to its deadly effects.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010420	To our forces, every shot aimed in the general direction of the lake was effective. One could argue that our members were far overqualified for this task, considering our reputation as talented archers.
QUEST_20180827_010421	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 4
QUEST_20180827_010422	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 4{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010423	There is a community of civilians residing at our lake.{nl}This community lives not near the tower — where the threat of war is constant — but relatively distant from it, in a small village on top of the lake.{nl}Parts of it were constructed on a magical levitation stone provided by the Schaffenstar, while others were built on ships or wooden structures.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010424	This community is now being targeted by Solcomm.{nl}The move was not unexpected, and we at the Schaffenstar are prepared to protect the village and its residents.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010425	It is, after all, our duty and responsibility to maintain the safety of a territory that is within our jurisdiction.{nl}On the other hand, the community is located beyond the range of the majority of projectiles that can be launched from the tower, and even our magic weapons will lose significant power when used at such long distances.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010426	Another factor is the depth of the lake itself, which remains unknown to both our forces and the demons'.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010427	Some fishermen are known to practice their trade at the lake. They pay a tax to Lydia Schaffen in return for protection.{nl}She may not possess the title of Lord, but effectively, Schaffen is both the owner and ruler of the territory delimited by the lake.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010428	The people living on the lake take great pride in having Lydia Schaffen as their sovereign, as the Schaffenstar continues to govern the community fairly and mercifully.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010429	To them, our leader represents less of a ruler and more of a guardian.{nl}Bar the Kingdom's largest cities, no place is as safe from the monsters as our lake.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010430	In the past, attempts by monsters to breach into our territory have never posed a problem.{nl}Our usual approaches, of course, are not adequate for the large numbers of demons we are now facing.{nl}On the other hand, there is no need to engage in a full-scale war.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010431	At the first signs of movement on Solcomm's camp, we closed off the borders.{nl}It may not have been a substantial measure, but given the location of the small island village, it was enough to deter an initial attack.{nl}Nonetheless, it would only be a matter of time before the demons could surround the village in their ships and destroy the barricades.{nl}They seemed to believe that we would not come to the aid of the villagers, and in a way they were correct.{nl}The whirlwinds that sprouted from the lake were enough to prevent them from doing any damage.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010432	The waterspouts were powerful enough to lift the demons in the air before letting them fall down into the lake, a view that was most entertaining.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010433	One disadvantage of this method was the difficulty of aiming the whirlwinds accurately at the enemy ships.{nl}Any vessel that encountered a waterspout, however, was immediately overturned, spilling its passengers into the lake.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010434	Those not directly affected by the waterspouts received indirect damage from the spraying of lake water above them and from all directions.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010435	As cruel as it may sound, it was truly a marvelous thing to see.{nl} 
QUEST_20180827_010436	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 5
QUEST_20180827_010437	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 5{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010438	Rumors have surfaced saying the demons intend to recruit human mercenaries.{nl}As it is, none have been courageous enough to consider standing against the Schaffenstar and our leader.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010439	It has been long since the demons have obstructed our movement of supplies, but there are no visible effects to the functioning of the tower.{nl}We are, I believe, better equipped to survive a siege than even the Three-Layered Castle Wall.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010440	Even in the unfortunate event of a tyrant like King Kadumel joining forces with the demons, the tower is prepared to sustain itself for centuries without external aid.{nl}The chances of a demon such as Solcomm ever invading the tower are close to none. 
QUEST_20180827_010441	Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 6
QUEST_20180827_010442	* Record of Defense Operations Against Solcomm Pt. 6{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010443	After six months of inactivity, Solcomm launched a full-scale attack on the tower.{nl}His forces were supplemented by a large number of flying demons and additional troops.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010444	The position of the lake's floating rocks is deep enough to prevent demon intruders, but too shallow to sale on a ship. Therefore, this time the demons forwent their vessels in favor of another method.{nl}They filled the bottom of the lake with boulders and rocks and used them to step over the water, slowly advancing into our territory.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010445	They continue to fill the lake, one step at a time.{nl}If a regular siege involves digging trenches around the target, in our battle the lake itself is a trench that must be filled.{nl}We await the results of the demons' efforts.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010446	The demons are restlessly making their way through the lake. As they are still beyond the range of our weapons, we continue to simply observe them.{nl}The only members on concrete duty are the sentinels atop the tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010447	It is still early to initiate an attack on the besieging troops, as is usual in a situation like ours.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010448	It wasn't until one day after the demons had begun advancing into the lake that we launched our first attack.{nl}By then, a few of Solcomm's subordinates were already within range of the tower's firepower.{nl}The first blow went over their heads, but the demons did not retaliate, focusing only on the task at hand.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010449	Hoping to minimize damage, the demon forces worked inside of siege towers and other structures, but even those did not survive our constant attacks.{nl}They continued to move into the lake slowly but surely.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010450	Eventually, the first line of their troops arrived at the entrance of the Astral Tower.{nl}Flying demons, who had been reducing damage by intercepting our catapult projectiles, were now headed for the tower itself.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010451	The operation now felt like a true battle.{nl}From the tower we launched boiling water, projectiles, arrows, fire and different kinds of magic.{nl}Apart from those lucky enough to land on the path created by the demons, the flying monsters were hit by our arrows, falling to the lake or on top of the floating rocks.{nl}Among the members of the Schaffenstar, there were no signs of distress.{nl}Then, something felt as if it were about to happen. Lydia Schaffen was standing by the rails atop the tower.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010452	She aimed her arrow at Solcomm, commander of the demon forces.{nl}It seemed as though she might have been waiting for him to notice her.{nl}The weapon in her hands was none other than the bow she had used to kill Ziburynas.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010453	Solcomm acknowledged her, but she did not fire.{nl}She put away the arrow and spoke.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010454	[You fool. The ground you are standing on is made of stone, it only floats on the water by magic.]{nl}The meaning of her words was uncertain, even to Solcomm.{nl}Soon, however, her intent was made clear by what happened next.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010455	The entire floor began to sink lower and lower.{nl}Demons who had remained unfazed through most of the battle were now screaming in agony.{nl}Water came in through all directions, melting and burning the demons.{nl}Solcomm was unable to prevent it.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010456	This attack had been the reason why our leader had wanted the demons to approach the tower.{nl}Even if they were to attempt escaping to land, the troops were more than an entire day away from the shore.{nl}
QUEST_20180827_010457	Few demons survived. Many members of the Schaffenstar were in shock, unable to fully grasp our victory.{nl}The defeat of the demons was tragic.

QUEST_20190223_010716	Abandoned Book
QUEST_20190223_010717	 The three rulers of Nicopolis are now more powerful than ever. Their greed knows no limits. Not satisfied with holding a grasp over Nicopolis, they are trying to influence life in the Kingdom beyond the city.{nl}
QUEST_20190223_010718	 His Majesty King Jusel is wise, and the Kingdom's young officials will not dare to taint their careers with bribes or illicit requests; I know the Court will not falter. What's more, the three of them are convinced that they themselves are the greatest wizards of our generation, above any Class Master. Surely they're going to use magic.
QUEST_20190223_010719	I believe they may try to seal off the city's borders and isolate it from the rest of the Kingdom, as a means to coerce the residents. Once the city is sealed off, the Kingdom will try and eventually tear down the barriers, but no one knows what might happen within the city until they succeed. 
QUEST_20190223_010720	Once the refuge is built, the Court can send out officials here to look after the site until the barriers are down.{nl}On the other hand, I worry that they may create a powerful magic weapon or use the city's residents to threaten the Kingdom. In that case, we can only hope the refuge will come in hand. 
QUEST_20190223_010721	Now that the Kedora Alliance has delivered the last materials, construction of the refuge is almost complete. Not only did we manage to build a place far from the gazes of the city rulers, we've also made good allies in the process. 
QUEST_20190223_010722	Should they try anything, having this shelter will allow us to denounce the rulers to the Court so they can be properly persecuted under the law. When that happens, I'm certain that better days will come to the city.{nl}- Written by Irredian, on a day of the reign of His Majesty King Jusel
QUEST_20190223_010723	Blackened Diary
QUEST_20190223_010724	To my beloved son,{nl}{nl}Thinking back, I am glad you decided to leave Nicopolis to work at the Court. I am glad I couldn't make you stay. I am writing this letter because I worry that you may try to come back after hearing what happened to the city.{nl}His Majesty cutting ties with all the incompetent Court officials and hiring young professionals like yourself is something unheard of in the last 300 years of our Kingdom's history.{nl}So don't worry about anything else, just focus on your work in the capital and serving our government.
QUEST_20190223_010725	You may hear rumors of the abuses our leaders are perpetrating, but please don't come back in vain. A great wizard by the name of Irredian is already preparing measures for an emergency, so there is no need to worry. He also built a shelter we can use if needed.{nl}I can't explain too much in detail, but the way I see it, if anything happens in Nicopolis we'll be safe as long as we're here.
QUEST_20190223_010726	Remember, Nicopolis is still under the Kingdom's jurisdiction. Neither the Pervading Queen nor the Quipmage will be able to get away with hurting our residents. If they do try that, we can always escape to the shelter. You know, your dad may not be a high-ranks wizard, but I can tell for certain that this shelter is going to survive any disaster that comes our way.{nl}So please, don't think about me being here on my own. Do your duty as a loyal vassal of His Majesty's and be the greatest administrator this Court has ever seen.{nl}- Year three hundred and... (illegible)

QUEST_20190223_010730	Scribbled Paper
QUEST_20190223_010731	What is going on with Nicopolis?{nl}The Quipmage and the Specter, and the so-called Queen are making things worse.{nl}They keep people from moving out, so the rest of the Kingdom doesn't know what's happening.{nl}I'm only glad Irredian is standing up to them.
QUEST_20190223_010732	At least here we don't see the Quipmage, so I'm happy.
QUEST_20190223_010733	When the Pervading Queen first started to call herself that, she was only half-joking.{nl}Now, she's like a character out of a children's story.
QUEST_20190223_010734	This place was well made, sure, but I don't see it lasting forever.{nl}If things get worse in Nicopolis, I might have to consider leaving the city altogether.{nl}I just wish the king would send in a secret envoy to investigate...{nl}If he knew, he wouldn't let those three ruin the city...
